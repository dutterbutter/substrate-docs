The following is a guide outlining the steps to setup a standalone DKG node. The guide assumes you are setting up
a node on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, and already have ssh access to the server from your preferred cloud provider. 
This guide's purpose is to help you get started with the DKG node setup process, not to advise on how to setup a node securely. Please
take additional security and privacy measures into consideration.

## Provisioning a server

It is recommended to change the hostname of the server to something identifiable to you. To do this, run the following command:

```
# Login with ssh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR SSH PRIVATE KEY> root@<YOUR VPS PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>
```

Change the hostname by running:

```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <NEW_HOSTNAME>
```

Edit the hosts file to add your new hostname to the 127.0.0.1. Replace the old hostname with the new one.

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Change the following line:
```
127.0.0.1 <OLD_HOST_NAME> to 127.0.0.1 <NEW_HOST_NAME>
```

Type `ctrl+o` to save, `ctrl+x` to exit

Reboot (You will be kicked off... wait a couple minutes before logging in)
```
reboot
```

### Create non-root user

It is recommended to create a non-root user to run the node. To do this, run the following command:
```
useradd <USERNAME> && passwd <USERNAME>
usermod -aG sudo <USERNAME>
```

Give permissions to new user (please type sudo here... even as root user)
```
sudo visudo
```

Add entry for new user under "User privilege specification"
```
<USERNAME> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Add directory and permissions
```
# create directory
mkdir /home/<USERNAME>

# add permissions
chown <USERNAME>:<USERNAME> /home/<USERNAME> -R
```

Copy pub key to new user:
```
rsync --archive --chown=<USERNAME>:<USERNAME> ~/.ssh /home/<USERNAME>
```

Set new user's login shell to bash
```
chsh -s /bin/bash <USERNAME>
```

Great! You have now created a non-root user, given that user appropiate permissions, and created a directory for the user. 
Let's `exit` the shell, and log in as the new user.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR SSH PRIVATE KEY> <USERNAME>@<YOUR VPS PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>
```

## System service setup
### 1. Installing dkg-substrate and setting it up as a system service

First, clone the dkg-substrate repo, and install any dependencies.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install jq
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential git clang curl libssl-dev pkg-config llvm libudev-dev libgmp3-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 2. Rust developer environment

This guide uses https://rustup.rs installer and the rustup tool to manage the Rust toolchain. First install and configure rustup:

```
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```
rustup default stable
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### 3. Clone and build dkg-substrate repo
```
git clone git@github.com:webb-tools/dkg-substrate.git
cd dkg-substrate

cargo build --release --locked -p egg-standalone-node
```

### 4. Generating node keys - this file will be referenced in our service configuration file.

You can generate a node's libp2p key by the following:

```
# Usage
# subkey generate-node-key --file <output-file>

# Example
subkey generate-node-key --file node-key
```

Output:
```
12D3KooWAhzqC4xstZKkAVYge2Q9tAMcnFhNEabLejRNVoQWLHHC
```

The peer ID is displayed on screen and the actual key is saved in the **output-file**.

### 5. Set up the node as a system service. 

Run the following commands to create the service configuration file:

```
# Move the egg-standalone-node binary to the bin directory (assumes you are in repo root directory)
sudo mv ./target/release/egg-standalone-node /usr/bin/

# navigate to /etc
cd /etc/systemd/system

# create the service configuration file
sudo touch standalone.service
```

Add the following contents to the service configuration file. Make sure to replace the **USERNAME** with the username you created in the previous step, and update 
any paths or ports to your own preference. 

**Note:** The below configuration assumes you are targeting the Arana chain spec and has debugging logs on by default.

```
[Unit]
Description=DKG Standalone Node
After=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
User=<USERNAME>
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
ExecStart=/usr/bin/egg-standalone-node \
  --base-path /tmp/standalone/<USERNAME> \
  --name <NODE-NAME> \
  --chain "/home/<USERNAME>/egg-net/resources/arana-standalone-raw.json" \
  --node-key-file "/home/<USERNAME>/node-key" \
  --port 30333 \
  --ws-port 9944 \
  --validator \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --no-mdns  \
  --rpc-cors "*" \
  -lerror -ldkg=debug -ldkg_metadata=debug -lruntime::offchain=debug -ldkg_proposal_handler=debug

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 6. Enable the services

Double check that the config has been written to `/etc/systemd/system/standalone.service` correctly. If so, enable the service so it runs on startup, and then try to start it now:

```
sudo systemctl enable standalone
sudo systemctl start standalone
```

Check the status of the service:
```
systemctl status standalone
```

You should see the node connecting to the network and syncing the latest blocks. If you need to tail the latest output, you can use:
```
journalctl -u standalone.service -f
```

Congratulations! You have officially provisioned a server and setup a DKG node for the Webb standalone test network.
