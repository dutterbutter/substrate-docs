The Webb protocol is a private bridge protocol building on top of the chainbridge and Tornado cash protocols. It combines these architectures to create an interoperable privacy set to enable cross-chain private transactions with scalable privacy. More tokens on a particular bridge and more chains connected on a particular bridge only serve to increase the amount of privacy provided by that particular bridge.
