This page will guide you through the installation steps required to build the DKG.

## 1. Setup of Machine

The instructions outlined on [Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#manual-installation) will guide you through the **2 steps** needed to prepare a computer for building the DKG.
Since the DKG is built using Substrate and Substrate is built with [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), the first
thing you will need to do is prepare the computer for Rust development - these steps will vary based
on the computer's operating system. Once Rust is configured, you will use its toolchains to interact
with Rust projects; the commands for Rust's toolchains will be the same for all supported,
Unix-based operating systems.

### Using `aarch64-apple-darwin` toolchain

Install Homebrew if you have not already. You can check if you have it installed with the following command:

```bash
brew help
```

If you do not have it installed open the Terminal application and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Install Homebrew if necessary https://brew.sh/
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date, install openssl
brew update
brew install openssl
```

❗ **Note:** Native ARM Homebrew installations are only going to be supported at `/opt/homebrew`. After Homebrew installs, make sure to add `/opt/homebrew/bin` to your PATH.

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

In order to build **dkg-substrate** in `--release` mode using `aarch64-apple-darwin` Rust toolchain you need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
echo 'export RUSTFLAGS="-L /opt/homebrew/lib"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## 2. Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the DKG. This command will
build the
[Wasm Runtime](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _must_ use the release builds! The optimizations here are required
> as in debug mode, it is expected that nodes are not able to run fast enough to produce blocks.
