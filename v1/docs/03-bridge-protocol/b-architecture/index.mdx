# Protocol

Given ***G=(A,E)*** a graph of anchors and edges between them. Fix an element schema/structure ***S*** for element hashes inserted into 
the anchors’ merkle trees.

1. Users insert elements as hashes of the predefined structure into anchors.
2. Oracles listen for insertions, construct `EdgeMetadata` objects, and relay these objects to the external governance system.
3. Oracles listen for output from the external governance system and relay this output to the target anchors.
4. Each anchor processes received output containing `EdgeMetadata` objects and updates their internal `EdgeList`.
5. Users generate proofs of membership of their insertions in *one-of-many* of the anchors’ merkle trees and target submission on one anchor. 
Upon completion they submit these proofs to the relayer network.
6. Relayers listen for delegations and submit these proofs to their target anchor, where they are verified on-chain.

## Architecture of an Anchor Protocol Instance

Below is an illustration of how an Anchor Protocol instance interacts with other network participants, namely a governing distributed 
key generation protocol, and the oracle / relayer network. We model the external governance system as a DKG which generates threshold 
signatures of proposals, specifically of EdgeMetadata objects. These signed proposals are used to update the anchors on each compatible blockchain.

**Oracle / Relayer Responsibilities**

1. Listen for insertions on the anchors and construct `EdgeMetadata` events.
2. Vote on the `EdgeMetadata` event on the DKG Signing Chain.
3. Relay signed proposals to Signature bridge

**Signature Bridge Responsibilities**

1. Receive signed proposals
2. Verify signature is signed by the DKG public key.
3. Parse Signed Proposal data to hand off to appropriate Anchor Handlers

**Anchor Responsibilities**

1. Insert merkle root updates
2. Execute proposals

**DKG Responsibilities**

1. Generate a distributed key.
2. Sign proposals by generating a valid threshold signature if and only if a proposal receives some threshold of oracle votes.

### History

The Webb ecosystem started building on top of the Chainbridge and Tornado cash protocols. We combined these architectures to create 
an interoperable privacy set to enable cross-chain private transactions with scalable privacy and further to inspire the more general 
Anchor Protocol spec.

Our goal was to merge and augment both the Chainbridge and Tornado cash protocols and increase the relayer responsibilities to design 
our private bridge protocol. The modifications can be summarized as:

- Augmenting Tornado's into Anchor's which additionally track an edge list to other Anchors.
    - Anchors are private transaction systems that function both as Tornados but also as cross-chain bridges.
    - Anchors use a zero-knowledge one-of-many merkle tree membership proof instead of one for a single merkle tree.
    - Anchors can mint/burn the underlying token being deposited and withdrawn.
- Augmenting ChainBridge's Bridge into a private bridge protocol.
    - We create a new AnchorHandler which modifiers the edge list of Anchors needing updates.
    - We augment the Bridge relayers w/ a multi-party threshold signing scheme, so that one or many threshold networks can govern the bridge.
