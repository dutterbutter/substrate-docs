The first application weâ€™re building is a bridged system between a smart contract protocol (or pallet protocol)
and a distributed key generation [DKG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation) protocol.
At the highest level, the smart contract protocol requires some entity to govern it and the DKG acts as the
governor.

The smart contract protocol (or pallet protocol) is a bridge between merkle trees on different blockchains.
The primary goal of the bridge protocol is to satisfy 2 properties:

- **Liveness** - the bridge can continue to be updated in an partially-synchronous environment
- **Safety** - the bridge updates are always guaranteed to be valid

The Anchor protocol is a non-custodial private bridge protocol that uses smart contracts to bootstrap a
zero-knowledge bridge. It is designed to work in all possible smart contracting environments. The current
working repos for this protocol are targeting the EVM & Rust based chains such as Substrate.

The Webb ecosystem includes a private bridge protocol building on top of the chainbridge and Tornado cash protocols.
It combines these architectures to create an interoperable privacy set to enable cross-chain private transactions
with scalable privacy. More tokens on a particular bridge and more chains connected on a particular bridge only
serve to increase the amount of privacy provided by that particular bridge.

The bridge protocol connects [merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) across chains. We refer to
the connected instances of the system as **_Anchors_**. Every anchor has an on-chain merkle tree and tracks a set
of connected anchors across chain (through edges) in its local storage. An edge is a directed connection/link/edge
between 2 anchors. In the language of graphs. A bridge is a graph G=(A, E) where A is the set of anchor nodes and
E is the set of edges between them. We represent this data structure using an `Edge` or `EdgeMetadata` that looks
like:

```bash
// An edge for a specific chain
pub struct EdgeMetadata<ChainID, Element, LastLeafIndex> {
	/// chain id of the connected merkle tree
	pub src_chain_id: ChainID,
	/// root of source chain anchor's native merkle tree
	pub root: Element,
	/// height of source chain anchor's native merkle tree
	pub latest_leaf_index: LastLeafIndex,
}
```

## Leaves in the merkle trees (anchors)

We put hashes inside the merkle tree. Oftentimes these hashes are hashes of structured data that is relevant for
an end-user application. For example, we might be the hash of a [unspent transaction output (UTXO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output)
into the tree to allow someone across chain to prove knowledge of a UTXO in one anchor from a different anchor
directly.
