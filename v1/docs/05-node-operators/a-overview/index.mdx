## Introduction

Running a full node on the Eggnet allows you to connect to the network, 
sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, and more. Running a full node
is not the same as running a collator node. Full nodes follow the chain and import all blocks that 
are being produced. Whereas, collator nodes do everything a full node can but can also author blocks and 
should have more security consideration during setup. 

## Requirements
Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node 
is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain, and 
facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table and follow the recommended [Polkadot requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

| Component | Requirements                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                                     |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).         |
| Memory    | 64GB ECC                                                                                                     |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br />       - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |
            
            
## Running Ports

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain, 
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened.

**Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |


**Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30334 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9934        |
| WS          | 9945        |
| Prometheus  | 9616        |


## Installation
There are a couple different guides to help you get started running a Eggnet node:

- Using Docker - this method provides a quick and easy way to get started with a Docker container
- Using Systemd - this method is recommended for those with experience compiling a Substrate node

## Logs and Troubleshooting
You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by [Relaychain], while the parachain has no prefix. 
If you would like to run the node with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`. 

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```

### P2P Ports Not Open
If you don't see an Imported message (without the [Relaychain] tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync
Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either Imported or Idle messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching
If you notice similar log messages as below:

```
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.
