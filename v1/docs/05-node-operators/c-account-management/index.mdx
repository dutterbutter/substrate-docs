Once your collator node has fully syncronized with the Kusama Relay Chain you may proceed to setup the 
necessary accounts to operate a collator node. 

## Session Keys

Collator operators need to set their `Author` session keys. Run the following command to author session keys.
**Note:** You may need to change `http://localhost:9933` to your correct address. 

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```

Result will look like this, copy the key:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x400e3cef43bdessab331e4g03115c4bcecws3cxff608fa3b8sh6b07y369386570","id":1}
```

## Set session keys

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Developer > Extrinsic`.
2. Select your collator account and extrinsic type: session / setKeys.
3. Enter the session keys and set proof to `0x00`.
4. Submit the transaction.

## Identity

Collator operators need to set their identity. 

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Accounts`
2. Open the 3 dots next to your collators address: `Set on-chain Identity`
3. Enter all fields you want to set.
4. Send the transaction.

## Request judgment

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Developer > Extrinsic`
2. Select your collator account and extrinsic type: `identity / requestJudgment`
3. Send the transaction.

## Bond funds

To start collating, you need to have x EGG tokens for Egg Network. It is highly recommended that you make your controller 
and stash accounts be two separate accounts. For this, you will create two accounts and make sure each of them have at least 
enough funds to pay the fees for making transactions. Keep most of your funds in the stash account since it is meant to be 
the custodian of your staking funds.

Make sure not to bond all your EGG balance since you will be unable to pay transaction fees from your bonded balance.

It is now time to set up our validator. We will do the following:

- Bond the EGG of the Stash account. These EGG tokens will be put at stake for the security of the network and can be slashed.
- Select the Controller. This is the account that will decide when to start or stop validating.

First, go to the Staking section. Click on "Account Actions", and then the "+ Stash" button. It should look something 
similar to the below image.

Once everything is filled in properly, click Bond and sign the transaction with your Stash account.

## Production blocks

Once your collator is active, you will see your name inside Network tab every time you produce a block!
