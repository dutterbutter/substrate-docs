Once your collator node has fully syncronized with the Kusama Relay Chain you may proceed to setup the 
necessary accounts to operate a collator node. 

## Session Keys

Collator operators need to set their `Author` session keys. Run the following command to author session keys:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```

Result will look like this, copy the key:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x400e3cef43bdessab331e4g03115c4bcecws3cxff608fa3b8sh6b07y369386570","id":1}
```

## Set session keys

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Developer > Extrinsic`.
2. Select your collator account and extrinsic type: session / setKeys.
3. Enter the session keys and set proof to `0x00`.
4. Submit the transaction.
