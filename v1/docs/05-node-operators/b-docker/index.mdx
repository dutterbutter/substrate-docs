## Introduction
Running a full node on a Egg network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, 
obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

## Installation Instructions

An Eggnet node can be spun up quickly using Docker. For more information on installing Docker, 
please visit this [page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). When connecting to Eggnet on Kusama, it will take a few days to completely 
sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the requirements which can read [here]().

Create a local directory to store chain data:

```
mkdir /var/lib/eggnet-data
```

Next, make sure you set the ownership and permissions accordingly for the local directory that stores the chain data. 

```
# chown to a specific user
chown DOCKER_USER /var/lib/eggnet-data

# chown to current user
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /var/lib/eggnet-data
```

Now, execute the docker run command. If you are setting up a collator node, make sure to follow the code 
snippets for "Collator".

**Full Node:**
```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/moonriver-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
purestake/moonbeam:v0.23.0 \
--base-path=/data \
--chain moonriver \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
--pruning archive \
--state-cache-size 0 \
--db-cache <50% RAM in MB> \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

**Collator Node:**

```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/moonbeam-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
purestake/moonbeam:v0.23.0 \
--base-path=/data \
--chain moonbeam \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--validator \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
--pruning archive \
--state-cache-size 0 \
--db-cache <50% RAM in MB> \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

Once Docker pulls the necessary images, your full Moonbeam (or Moonriver) node will start, displaying lots of information, 
such as the chain specification, node name, role, genesis state, and more:

**Note:** If you want to run an RPC endpoint, to connect Polkadot.js Apps, or to run your own application, use the flags --unsafe-rpc-external 
and/or --unsafe-ws-external to run the full node with external access to the RPC ports. More details are available by running moonbeam --help. 
This is not recommended for Collators.

During the syncing process, you will see messages from both the embedded relay chain and the parachain (without a tag). These messages display 
a target block (live network state) and a best block (local node synced state).

If you followed the installation instructions for Eggnet, once synced, you will be connected to peers and 
see blocks being produced on the Egg network! Note that in this case you need to also sync to the Kusama relay chain, which might take a few days.

### Purge Your Node
If you need a fresh instance of your Eggnet node, you can purge your node by removing the associated data directory.

You'll first need to stop the Docker container:
```
  sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID`
```

If you did not use the `-v` flag to specify a local directory for storing your chain data when you spun up your node, then the data folder is related to the 
Docker container itself. Therefore, removing the Docker container will remove the chain data.

If you did spin up your node with the -v flag, you will need to purge the specified directory. 
For example, for the suggested data directly, you can run the following command to purge your parachain and relay chain data:
```
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/eggnet-data/*
```

To only remove the parachain data for a specific chain, you can run:
```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/eggnet-data/chains/*
```

Similarly, to only remove the relay chain data, you can run:

```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/eggnet-data/polkadot/*
```

Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory. 
You can install the newest version by repeating the Installation Instructions. 
Make sure you are using the latest tag available, which you can find on the Eggnet GitHub repo.
