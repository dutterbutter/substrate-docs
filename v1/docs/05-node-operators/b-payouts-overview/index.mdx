## Introduction

Running a collator node on the Eggnet allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, and also 
author blocks. The network rewards collators (users running collator nodes and actively producing blocks) by paying a set amount of network 
tokens as rewards.

## How are rewards calculated

The collator rewards are paid out every block, the rewards consists of multiple components:

(1) Transaction fees from all transactions in the block
(2) Tips paid by users  
(3) Network reward amount 

The collator reward is initially paid out from the collator reward pot alloted at the time of genesis. Once the initial genesis supply for collator
rewards has been exhausted, the network will issue new amount of currency (at a predetermined rate of inflation) every block to continue
rewarding the collators. The block authors are chosen using [Aura](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_consensus_aura/index.html)
and ensures every collator gets a chance at block authoring.

## Reward Payout Schedule
The collator rewards are paid out every block, there is no lockup or delay for the payout. Please note that simply authoring a block
does not guarantee a reward, the block has to be accepted and finalised in the canonical chain for the payout to be valid. Also 
important to remember that rewards are only paid out to block authoring collators, simply running a node/full-node does not
make you eligible for a reward.
            
## Payout Example

Lets say `Alice` is running a collator node on egg-net, the collator node just authored a block, for simplicity lets consider the block 
contains 100 transactions each paying 0.1EGG in transaction fees, 5 transactions each with a tip of 1EGG.

This block has generated a total of 15 EGG in transaction fees and tips. The transaction fee is divided between the treasury and
block authory in 80:20 split. Also lets assume the `RewardAmount` for egg-net is set at 25EGG.

For the above block, the reward paid to `Alice` account is as follows

| Component       | Payout                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| TransactionFees | 2 EGG (20% of transaction fees)   |
| Tips            | 5 EGG  (100% of transaction tips) |
| Network Reward  | 25 EGG                            |
| Total Payout    | 32 EGG                            |
