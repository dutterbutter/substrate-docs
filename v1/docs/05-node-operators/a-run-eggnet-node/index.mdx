## Introduction

Running a node on the Eggnet allows you to connect to the network, 
sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, and more. Running a full node
is not the same as running a collator node. Full nodes follow the chain and import all blocks that 
are being produced. Whereas, collator nodes do everything a full node can but can also author blocks and 
should have more security consideration during setup. 

## Requirements
Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node 
is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain, and 
facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table and follow the recommended [Polkadot requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

| Component | Requirements                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                                     |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).         |
| Memory    | 64GB ECC                                                                                                     |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br />       - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |
            
            
## Running Ports

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain, 
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened.

**Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |


**Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30334 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9934        |
| WS          | 9945        |
| Prometheus  | 9616        |


## Install Rust and Dependencies

We will need to install Rust in order to build the Eggnet node. This guide uses https://rustup.rs 
installer and the rustup tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

If you have already installed Rust, run the following command to make sure you are using the latest version.

```
rustup update
```

If not, this command will fetch the latest version of Rust and install it (make sure you have `curl` installed).
```
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Verify your installation.
```
rustc --version
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest nightly version, and the nightly wasm target:

```
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Finally, run this command to install the necessary dependencies for compiling and running the Eggnet node software.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install jq
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential git clang curl libssl-dev pkg-config llvm libudev-dev libgmp3-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

It is also highly recommended install and configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) client if you intend to become 
a validator on the network. For more details on how to setup please visit the guide from Polkadot 
[here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#install--configure-network-time-protocol-ntp-client).

## Installation
To build an Eggnet node, you have 2 different options:

- From source
- Run a Docker container

### Eggnet Binary

You will need to build the Eggnet binary from the [webb-tools/eggnet repository](https://github.com/webb-tools/egg-net) on GitHub using the source code 
available in the `main` branch.

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/egg-net.git
cd egg-net
```

Build eggnet:
```
cargo build --release --locked -p egg-collator
```

**This step will take a while (generally 10 - 50 minutes, depending on your hardware).**

If you are interested in generating keys locally, you can also install subkey from the same directory. You may then take the generated subkey executable and transfer it to an air-gapped machine for extra security.

```
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey
```

### Run a Docker container

An Eggnet node can be spun up quickly using Docker. For more information on installing Docker, 
please visit this [page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). When connecting to Eggnet on Kusama, it will take a few days to completely 
sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the requirements which can read [here](https://docs.webb.tools/v1/node-operators/run-node/overview/#requirements).

Create a local directory to store chain data:

```
mkdir /var/lib/eggnet-data
```

Next, make sure you set the ownership and permissions accordingly for the local directory that stores the chain data. 

```
# chown to a specific user
chown DOCKER_USER /var/lib/eggnet-data

# chown to current user
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /var/lib/eggnet-data
```

Now, execute the docker run command to run a collator node. Be sure to add your own node name!

**Collator Node**
```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/eggnet-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
webb-tools/eggnet:edge \
--base-path=/data \
--chain eggnet \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--validator \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
--pruning archive \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

Now, execute the docker run command to run a full node. Be sure to add your own node name!

**Full Node:**
```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/eggnet-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
webb-tools/eggnet:edge \
--base-path=/data \
--chain eggnet \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
--pruning archive \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

### Required Keys

In order to participate in the distributed key generation protocol, block production, and block finalization, you will be required to set up a few keys. These keys 
include:
- DKG key (Ecdsa)
- Aura key (Sr25519)
- Account key (Sr25519)

To generate each of the above keys we will make use of [subkey](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/). You will need to install 
subkey before running the command. 

**Once installed, to generate the DKG key you can run the following:** 
```
egg-collator key insert --base-path /eggnet-data \
--chain "<APPLICABLE-CHAINSPEC>" \
--scheme Ecdsa \
--suri "<12-PHRASE-MNEMONIC>" \
--key-type wdkg
```

**To generate the Aura key you can run the following:**
```
egg-collator key insert --base-path /eggnet-data \
--chain "<APPLICABLE-CHAINSPEC>" \
--scheme Sr25519 \
--suri "<12-PHRASE-MNEMONIC>" \
--key-type aura
```

**To generate the Account key you can run the following:**
```
egg-collator key insert --base-path /eggnet-data \
--chain "<APPLICABLE-CHAINSPEC>" \
--scheme Sr25519 \
--suri "<12-PHRASE-MNEMONIC>" \
--key-type acco
```

### Synchronize Chain Data

You can begin syncing your node by running the following command:
```
./target/release/egg-collator --pruning=archive
```

Once your collator node has fully syncronized with the Kusama Relay Chain you may proceed to setup the 
necessary accounts to operate a collator node. 

## Bond funds

To start collating, you need to have x EGG tokens for Egg Network. It is highly recommended that you make your controller 
and stash accounts be two separate accounts. For this, you will create two accounts and make sure each of them have at least 
enough funds to pay the fees for making transactions. Keep most of your funds in the stash account since it is meant to be 
the custodian of your staking funds.

Make sure not to bond all your EGG balance since you will be unable to pay transaction fees from your bonded balance.

It is now time to set up our validator. We will do the following:

- Bond the EGG of the Stash account. These EGG tokens will be put at stake for the security of the network and can be slashed.
- Select the Controller. This is the account that will decide when to start or stop validating.

First, go to the Staking section. Click on "Account Actions", and then the "+ Stash" button. It should look something 
similar to the below image. 

![bond](../../../../src/images/docs/node-operator/bond.png)

Once everything is filled in properly, click Bond and sign the transaction with your Stash account.

## Session Keys

Collator operators need to set their `Author` session keys. Run the following command to author session keys.
**Note:** You may need to change `http://localhost:9933` to your correct address. 

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```

Result will look like this, copy the key:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x400e3cef43bdessab331e4g03115c4bcecws3cxff608fa3b8sh6b07y369386570","id":1}
```

### Set session keys

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Developer > Extrinsic`.
2. Select your collator account and extrinsic type: session / setKeys.
3. Enter the session keys and set proof to `0x00`.
4. Submit the transaction.

### Setting identity

Collator operators need to set their identity. 

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Accounts`
2. Open the 3 dots next to your collators address: `Set on-chain Identity`
3. Enter all fields you want to set.
4. Send the transaction.

### Request judgment

1. Go to the Polkadot.js portal: `Developer > Extrinsic`
2. Select your collator account and extrinsic type: `identity / requestJudgment`
3. Send the transaction.

### Production blocks

Once your collator is active, you will see your name inside Network tab every time you produce a block!

## Logs and Troubleshooting
You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by [Relaychain], while the parachain has no prefix. 
If you would like to run the node with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`. 

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```

### P2P Ports Not Open
If you don't see an Imported message (without the [Relaychain] tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync
Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either Imported or Idle messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching
If you notice similar log messages as below:

```
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.
