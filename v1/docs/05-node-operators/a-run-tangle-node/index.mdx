## Introduction

Running a node on the Tangle allows you to connect to the network,
sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, and more. Running a full node
is not the same as running a collator node. Full nodes follow the chain and import all blocks that
are being produced. Whereas, collator nodes do everything a full node can but can also author blocks and
should have more security consideration during setup.

## Requirements

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node
is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain, and
facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table and follow the recommended [Polkadot requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

| Component | Requirements                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                               |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).   |
| Memory    | 64GB ECC                                                                                               |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br /> - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |

## Running Ports

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain,
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened.

**Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |

**Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30334 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9934        |
| WS          | 9945        |
| Prometheus  | 9616        |

## Install Dependencies

We will need to install Rust in order to build the Tangle node. This guide uses https://rustup.rs
installer and the rustup tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

If you have already installed Rust, run the following command to make sure you are using the latest version.

```
rustup update
```

If not, this command will fetch the latest version of Rust and install it (make sure you have `curl` installed).

```
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Verify your installation.

```
rustc --version
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest nightly version, and the nightly wasm target:

```
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Finally, run this command to install the necessary dependencies for compiling and running the Tangle node software.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install jq
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential git clang curl libssl-dev pkg-config llvm libudev-dev libgmp3-dev protobuf-compiler && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

It is also highly recommended install and configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) client if you intend to become
a validator on the network. For more details on how to setup please visit the guide from Polkadot
[here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#install--configure-network-time-protocol-ntp-client).

## Node Installation

To build an Tangle node, you have 2 different options:

- From source
- Run a Docker container

### Tangle Binary

You will need to build the Tangle binary from the [webb-tools/tangle repository](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle) on GitHub using the source code
available in the `main` branch.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle.git
cd tangle
```

Build tangle:

```
cargo build --release --locked -p tangle-collator
```

**This step will take a while (generally 10 - 50 minutes, depending on your hardware).**

If you are interested in generating keys locally, you can also install subkey from the same directory. You may then take the generated subkey executable and transfer it to an air-gapped machine for extra security.

```
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey
```

### Run a Docker container

An Tangle node can be spun up quickly using Docker. For more information on installing Docker,
please visit this [page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). When connecting to Tangle on Kusama, it will take a few days to completely
sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the requirements which can read [here](https://docs.webb.tools/v1/node-operators/run-node/overview/#requirements).

The current [Dockerfile](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/tree/main/docker) creates the `/tangle` directory, and sets the appropiate permissions to that directory for chain data storage. However,
if you want to specify a different directory to store chain data follow the steps below.

Create a local directory to store chain data:

```
mkdir /var/lib/tangle-data
```

Next, make sure you set the ownership and permissions accordingly for the local directory that stores the chain data.

```
# chown to a specific user
chown DOCKER_USER /var/lib/tangle-data

# chown to current user
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /var/lib/tangle-data
```

Now, execute the docker run command to run a collator node. Be sure to add your own node name!

**Note:** The below commands utilizes the newly created directory above rather than the `/tangle` directory by default.

### Run a Collator Node

```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/tangle-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
webb-tools/tangle:edge \
--base-path=/data \
--chain tangle \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--validator \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
--pruning archive \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

Now, execute the docker run command to run a full node. Be sure to add your own node name!

### Run a Full Node

```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/tangle-data:/data" \
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
webb-tools/tangle:edge \
--base-path=/data \
--chain tangle \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME" \
--execution wasm \
--wasm-execution compiled \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--pruning 1000 \
--name="YOUR-NODE-NAME (Embedded Relay)"
```

## Logs and Troubleshooting

You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by [Relaychain], while the parachain has no prefix.
If you would like to run the node with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`.

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```

### P2P Ports Not Open

If you don't see an Imported message (without the [Relaychain] tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either Imported or Idle messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching

If you notice similar log messages as below:

```
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.
