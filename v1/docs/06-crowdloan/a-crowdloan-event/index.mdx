The Kusama Network allows Parachains to source tokens for their Parachain bids in a decentralized crowdloan. 
Webb and Egg network intend to conduct a crowdloan campaign to secure a Parachain slot on Kusama. 
Kusama is a sharded, multi-chain network that allows blockchains to connect for interoperability, scalability, 
and plug-and-play network security. To join the Kusama network, all parachains must participate in and win a 
unpermissioned candle auction to secure a slot on the network. Parachains can choose to raise KSM in a variety of 
ways in order to participate in the auction.

## Key Points

- The Eggnet Crowdloan is happening soon, join the waitlist, and be sure you're eligible to participate with a compatible wallet and KSM tokens on hand. 
- The Eggnet Crowdloan is a community-backed launch for individuals looking to contribute to the growth of the Webb network and applications. 
- Contributed KSM will be returned at the end of the Eggnet parachain lease.
- The lease period (KSM locked period) is 48 weeks. EGG will be distributed after Eggnet launches and transfers are enabled.
- Contributions are vested entirely over the lease period.
- Eligibility: no KYC is required, but participants must agree to Terms & Conditions where participants from certain jurisdictions are excluded

### EGG Token

- EGG is the native token of the Egg network. 
- EGG has a fixed supply of 100,000,000.
- The token reward pool is set at 5,000,000 EGG tokens 
- Reward: 50 EGG for every 1 KSM contributed. 
- EGG can be used for paying transaction fees, and voting on governance proposals 

## Parachain Auction

### Purpose of Eggnet Crowdloan 

Webb has chosen to host a Crowdloan to trustlessly crowdsource KSM, which will be used to participate in the Kusama parachain auction. 
The KSM will be bonded, or 'locked', in the Kusama Relay Chain for the duration of Eggnet's parachain lease. The Parachain slot auctions 
follow a modified [candle auction](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction#mechanics-of-a-candle-auction) format. 

### Crowdloan Mechanism 

The crowdloan mechanism allows people to contribute by agreeing to lock up their own KSM until the end of the 
lease. EGG token (the native token of Egg Network) is distributed based on the amount a user lock and when 
he/she locks. 

The crowdloan mechanism can be summarized as follows:
- Create a crowdloan campaign, set a maximum of the total allowed contribution and set a campaign end date.
- Invite the community to participate in the crowdloan campaign.
- Crowdloan contributors initiate a special transaction allocating transferable KSM to the campaign's index. **Contributors should NOT send KSM to an external account.**
- KSM contributions can be submitted throughout the duration of the crowdloan campaign or until an auction is won, up to the maximum amount of contributions set by the parachain team when creating the campaign.
- If the Egg network wins an auction, the chain will be deployed at the start of the lease, and and the full amount of KSM contributed to the campaign index will remain locked for the duration of the lease.
- KSM contributed during the crowdloan will be returned to the contributor's at the conclusion of the lease period. 

### Prepare your KSM for Participation

If you are staking KSM you must unbond the KSM in order to participate in the crowdloan. Currently the unbonding period on Kusama
is 7 days.
