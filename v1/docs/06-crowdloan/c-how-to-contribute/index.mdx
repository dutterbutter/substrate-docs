Participate via Karura official website using Polkadot{.js} browser extension. Use a referral link to get an extra 5% bonus. Wallet setup guide here. 
Participate via partner exchanges.
Participate via partner mobile wallets.

Check prerequisites

I have installed the Polkadot.js browser extension.
I have KSM in my Polkadot.js account.
My KSM has been ‘unbonded’. Click here for instructions on unbonding if you’re staking KSM in Polkadot.js, or find the unstake/unbond option in your mobile wallet.

Once you have connected the Polkadot{js} extension wallet, you shall see your KSM balance, and contribution amount to Karura if any.

To participate in the crowdloan, you must read and accept the terms and conditions. You are required to sign with the account used to participate in the crowdloan, but it will not cost you anything.
