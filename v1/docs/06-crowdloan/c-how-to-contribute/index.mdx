The best way to contribute to the Eggnet crowdloan is through the official Egg Network crowdloan 
page using the Polkadot{.js} browser extension.

### Check prerequisites

- I have installed the Polkadot.js browser extension.
- I have KSM in my Polkadot.js account.
- My KSM has been 'unbonded'. Click [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-unbond) for instructions on unbonding if you're staking KSM in Polkadot.js, or find the unstake/unbond option in your mobile wallet.
