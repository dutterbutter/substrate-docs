This is the official documentation hub for Webb developers. This guide is broken down into several sections that
explain the principles and design decisions that make up Webb.

Webb is an ecosystem of privacy protocols and products for a multi-chain world. In this site, you can find 
information about the protocols we are actively building, the open-source repos we maintain, and other privacy
related research and ideas we aim to integrate into our community.

## Philosophy & Ethos

We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and that this needs to extend into the blockchain space
sooner rather than later. On blockchain platforms today, we continually expose our data when we participate in
the myriad of protocols that exist in the multi-chain world. We move assets across chains to buy NFTs, pay our
contributors and employees in cryptocurrency, invest w/ cryptocurrency, and generate large amounts of data that
can be mined by anyone with an internet connection.

Our mission is to change this by contributing to the growing amount of privacy tools that exist on blockchains
today. We are motivated by cross-chain user behavior and want to tackle cross-chain privacy first. You can find
more info about our cross-chain protocols in the [Bridge Protocol]() section of the docs site.

## Privacy Today

Privacy is lacking in a variety of places in our current blockchain ecosystem. We don't have:

1. Privacy-preserving asset transfer across chains.
2. Privacy-preserving RPC infrastructure for users of protocols.
3. Privacy-preserving custody and exchanges w/ meaningful liquidity.

The first item is what we are tackling with the `Webb` bridge protocol. It is an interoperable, zero-knowledge
proof based cross-chain system for privately moving assets between blockchains. It is a Privacy-as-a-Service 
protocol that unifies assets under consistent, interoperable representations to scale privacy sets as large as
possible. We are working on a fixed-sized deposit based system and plan to build out a fully shielded, 
interoperable protocol in the future.

The second item is what we will tackle next first on top of the `Webb` bridge protocol. We aim to make privacy
infrastructure easily deployable and easily usable by end products. When users of zero-knowledge-based, privacy
protocols generate their zero-knowledge proofs, they need to possess private inputs. Oftentimes, retrieving the
necessary private inputs requires querying public infrastructure, which exposes the user's privacy. The solution
in theory is simple and harder in practice; we need to build private information retrieval systems for these
datasets. As the `Webb` system launches and grows, we will begin integrating private information retrieval into
our infrastructure.

The third item is an active research area for our project. With a private bridge protocol, it becomes possible
to build novel multi-party protocols on top. We are actively investigating building privacy-preserving 
decentralised exchanges over the `Webb` bridge. These protocols can leverage advances in multi-party computation
to provide both novel custody solutions of shielded assets as well as dark-pool functionality over our `Webb` 
architecture.
