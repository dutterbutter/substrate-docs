The Webb ecosystem at its core is simply a privacy preserving cross-chain data exchange.
More precisely, Webb makes use of merkle trees deployed on various networks that communicate
updates with one another through a relayer network, and is governed by a distributed key
generation protocol. The first application built on top of this infrastructure is Webbâ€™s
Bridge Protocol, which allows assets to be privately moved across blockchains. The vision
for Webb is to further abstract the privacy preserving cross-chain data exchange properties
to the extent many creative applications may be built. The bridge protocol demonstrates the
intended usability of the Webb network and will be discussed in greater detail throughout the
documentation.
