Weâ€™re building a bridged system between a smart contract protocol (or pallet protocol) and a [distributed key generation (DKG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation) protocol. At the highest level, the smart contract protocol requires some entity to govern it and the DKG acts as the governor.
**The smart contract protocol (or pallet protocol) is a bridge between merkle trees on different blockchains.** The primary goal of the bridge protocol is to satisfy 2 properties:

- **Liveness** - the bridge can continue to be updated in an partially-synchronous environment
- **Safety** - the bridge updates are always guaranteed to be valid
