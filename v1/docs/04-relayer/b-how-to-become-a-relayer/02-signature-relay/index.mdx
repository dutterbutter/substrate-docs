## Data Proposing and Signature Relaying

To set up the relayer exclusively for data proposing and signature relaying we need to add the following fields to under the 
`[evm.<network>.contracts]` section:

### Required Fields

- Set `contract`: name of the contract to support (e.g. "VAnchor")
- Set `address`: address of the contract 
- Set `events-watcher` to `true`
- Set `withdraw-fee-percentage`
- Set `withdraw-gaslimit`
- Set `proposal-signing-backend`
- Set `linked-anchors`

Under the `[features]` section we need to turn off data-querying and private-relaying.

- Set `data-query` to `false`
- Set `governance-relay` to `true`
- Set `private-relay` to `false`
```

An example configuration file for the goerli network and VAnchor and SignatureBridge contract should look similar to this:

[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "VAnchor"
address = "0x03b88eD9Ff9bE84e4baD3F55D67AE5ABA610523C"
deployed-at = 6896976
events-watcher = { enabled = true }
withdraw-fee-percentage = 0
withdraw-gaslimit = "0x350000"
proposal-signing-backend = { type = "DKG", private-key = "$GOVERNOR_PRIVATE_KEY" }
linked-anchors = [
  { chain = "ropsten", address = "0x228aC202fB6Ad3D3A39f59E4A578a0EAFD3286CD" },
  { chain = "rinkeby", address = "0xa238c5987142AF720B9232d9d72A12A3868396e0" },
  { chain = "polygontestnet", address = "0xA8665042EA4767FA09143bd790059cE53Bdf2a8F" },
  { chain = "optimismtestnet", address = "0x09d2D6520BE3922549c81885477258F41c96c43f" },
  { chain = "arbitrumtestnet", address = "0x2D21BC3f8cb399d3b7091309AFe1986cdB9F2e39" },
]

[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "SignatureBridge"
address = "0xc11a9f2f42cedf687ec292231698a91dd6928d9a"
deployed-at = 6896976
events-watcher = { enabled = true, polling-interval = 10000, print-progress-interval = 0 }
```
