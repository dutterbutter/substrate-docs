## Private Transaction Relaying
 
To set up the relayer exclusively for relaying private transactions we need to add the following fields to under the 
`[evm.<network>.contracts]` section:

### Required Fields

- Set `contract`: name of the contract to support (e.g. "VAnchor")
- Set `address`: address of the contract 
- Set `events-watcher` to `false`
- Set `withdraw-fee-percentage`
- Set `withdraw-gaslimit`

Under the `[features]` section we need to turn off data-querying and governance-relaying.

- Set `data-query` to `false`
- Set `governance-relay` to `false`

An example configuration file for the goerli network and VAnchor contract should look similar to this:

```
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "VAnchor"
address = "0x03b88eD9Ff9bE84e4baD3F55D67AE5ABA610523C"
deployed-at = 6896976
events-watcher = { enabled = false }
withdraw-fee-percentage = 0
withdraw-gaslimit = "0x350000"

[features]
data-query = false
governance-relay = false
```
