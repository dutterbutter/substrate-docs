The relayer system is composed of three main components. Each of these components should be thought 
of as entirely separate because they could be handled by different entities entirely.
 
1. Private transaction relaying (for bridged transactions)
2. Data querying (for zero-knowledge proof generation)
3. Data proposing and signature relaying (of DKG proposals)
 
This document serves as a guide for setting up the relayer for all three components collectively or exclusively. 
Below you will find everything you need to join the Webb Relayer Network.
 
The easiest way to setup a relayer is to make use of the docker-compose file that is included in the 
[relayer repository](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) but before 
we download and run Docker we need to configure our relayer. The first step is to create an `.env` file 
in the root directory which lists the networks you wish to support along with the following fields:

```
# enables the network 
WEBB_EVM_<network>_ENABLED=true

# private key with funds on the network to cover gas costs
WEBB_EVM_<network>_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

# an optional beneficiary to receive rewards for relaying
WEBB_EVM_<network>_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
```

The current relayer network supports the following chains:
- Rinkeby
- Goerli
- Ropsten 
- Kovan
- Optimism Testnet
- Arbitrum Testnet 
- Mumbia Testnet (Polygon)
- Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam)

An example `.env` file that supports all the networks is shown below:

```
WEBB_EVM_RINKEBY_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_GOERLI_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_ROPSTEN_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_KOVAN_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_OPTIMISM_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_ARBITRUM_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_POLYGON_TESTNET_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_MOONBASE_ENABLED=true

RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
ROPSTEN_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
KOVAN_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
OPTIMISM_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
ARBITRUM_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
POLYGON_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
MOONBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

WEBB_EVM_RINKEBY_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_GOERLI_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_ROPSTEN_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>

WEBB_EVM_OPTIMISM_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_ARBITRUM_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_POLYGON_TESTNET_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_MOONBASE_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
```

# Network and Contract Configuration 
 
The relayer's configuration is comprised of two parts:

1. Network configuration
2. Contract configuration 

The network contract configuration is dependent on the network support configuration. That is, you cannot configure
a specific networks contracts without first configuring the network support configuration. 

To configure the relayer we suggest making use of the preset configurations in the `/config` directory. There you will 
see `.toml` files for all the supported networks and contracts. However, if you wish to custom configure 
your relayer you may do so. See below for more details.

## Network configuration

The relayer must be configured with the network support configuration. User's may choose which networks they wish to support 
but must specify these networks in a `.toml` file under the `/config` directory. The current relayer network supports both 
EVM and Substrate based chains but differ slightly in their configuration. 

### EVM based networks configuration 

The naming convention for the EVM based networks is `[evm.<network>]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the Goerli network you need to add `[evm.goerli]` at the beginning of the network configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the Goerli network:

```
[evm.goerli]
http-endpoint = "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161"
ws-endpoint = "wss://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161"
chain-id = 5
private-key = "$GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### Required Fields

These are the required fields that must be specified in order to support a network.

- **`http-endpoint`**: RPC url for a specific node
- **`ws-endpoint`**: Websocket endpoint for long living connections
- **`chain-id`**: Chain identifier for the specified chain (e.g. 1 for ETH mainnet, 5 for Goerli)
- **`private-key`**: Private key for an account on this network, be sure this account has funds (e.g.  "$GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY")

### Substrate based networks configuration 

The naming convention for the Substrate based networks is `[substrate.<network>]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the Egg network you need to add `[substrate.eggnet]` at the beginning of the network configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the Egg network:

```
[substrate.eggnet]
enabled=true
http-endpoint = "http://standalone.webb.tools:9933/"
ws-endpoint = "ws://standalone.webb.tools:9944/"
runtime = "WebbProtocol"
suri = "//Alice//stash"
pallets = []
```

### Required Fields

These are the required fields that must be specified in order to support a network.

- **`http-endpoint`**: RPC url for a specific node
- **`ws-endpoint`**: Websocket endpoint for long living connections
- **`runtime`**: Indicate what runtime to utilize
- **`suri`**: Used to generate keypair for the account on this network, be sure the account has funds
- **`pallets`**: Used to indicate what pallet to support

## Network contract configuration

The naming convention for the EVM based network contracts is `[evm.<network>.contracts]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the Goerli network you need to add `[evm.goerli.contracts]` at the beginning of that networks contract configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the contracts on the Goerli network:

```
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "SignatureBridge"
address = "0xc11a9f2f42cedf687ec292231698a91dd6928d9a"
deployed-at = 6896976
events-watcher = { enabled = true, polling-interval = 10000, print-progress-interval = 0 }
```

The relayer network is used to support the following contracts:
- Anchor contract
- VAnchor contract
- SignatureBridge contract

To support each contract you are required to specify each contract with the required fields. The required fields are 
dependent on what actions you wish your relayer to perform (e.g. private tx relaying, governance relaying, and data querying). 

Below is a full example of the network contract configuration for the Goerli network supporting the VAnchor bridge contract. 

```
# Block which represents the configuration for a supported contract on the network
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]

# The contract can be one of these values
# - Anchor (Fixed Anchor)
# - VAnchor (Variable Anchor)
# - SignatureBridge
contract = "VAnchor"

# The address of the contract
address = "0x682faa319bf7bae7f0cb68435e857d22bf976e17"

# The deployed block number of the contract. When a relayer does not have information for
# this contract in its store, it will start to sync and query for relevant historical data
# starting at this block number
deployed-at = 7146565

# The minimum size configured for deposit / withdraw on the contract
size = 0.01

# Configuration for the events watcher of this contract. The events-watcher can be switched on/off
# and the polling interval specifies the period of time (in ms) that the events-watcher thread
# will wait before issuing another query for new events.
events-watcher = { enabled = true, polling-interval = 15000 }

# Configuration for private transaction relaying which determines the fee taken by this relayer 
withdraw-fee-percentage = 0

# Value for private transaction relaying which specifies the maximum amount of gas which will be
# used when submitting a withdraw transaction
withdraw-gaslimit = "0x350000"

# Entries for this anchor contract's connected edges.
# These fields are used to determine the generation of AnchorUpdate proposals
linked-anchors = [
  { chain = "arbitrumtestnet", address = "0x4953110789d0cb6de126f4ea88890670ccfe6906" },
  { chain = "ropsten", address = "0x66e04f6ae26c310e39f5bf24d873909e6d3b64c7" },
  { chain = "kovan", address = "0x148e8037ea12834117f3efd9e8990c16c1ff5653" },
  { chain = "polygontestnet", address = "0x1371efed369498718bee3eb5d58e5d3dec86be85" },
  { chain = "optimismtestnet", address = "0x5353cede4b8fea148fb1f66f45d3ec27bff2224d" },
  { chain = "rinkeby", address = "0x91127f21d63029eb5b2de05b4b1e9fd3497ee95b"},
  { chain = "moonbase", address = "0x0c5f4951f42eec082bd1356b9b41928b4f0e7542"}
]
```
