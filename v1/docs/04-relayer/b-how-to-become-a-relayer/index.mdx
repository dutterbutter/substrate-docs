The relayer system is composed of three main components. Each of these components should be thought 
of as entirely separate because they could be handled by different entities entirely.
 
1. Private transaction relaying (for bridged transactions)
2. Data querying (for zero-knowledge proof generation)
3. Data proposing and signature relaying (of DKG proposals)
 
This document serves as a guide for setting up the relayer for all three components collectively or exclusively. 
Below you will find everything you need to join the Webb Relayer Network.
 
The easiest way to setup a relayer is to make use of the docker-compose file that is included in the 
[relayer repository](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) but before 
we download and run Docker we need to configure our relayer. The first step is to create an `.env` file 
in the root directory which lists the networks you wish to support along with the following fields:

```
# enables the network 
WEBB_EVM_<network>_ENABLED=true

# private key with funds on the network to cover gas costs
WEBB_EVM_<network>_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

# an optional beneficiary to receive rewards for relaying
WEBB_EVM_<network>_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
```

The current relayer network supports the following chains:
- Rinkeby
- Goerli
- Harmony Testnet
- Optimism Testnet`
- Arbitrum Testnet 
- Mumbia Testnet (Polygon)
- Fuji Testnet (Avalanche)
- Aurora Testnet (NEAR)

An example `.env` file that supports all the networks is shown below:

```
WEBB_EVM_HARMONYMAINNET0_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_RINKEBY_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_POLYGON_TESTNET_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_GOERLI_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_KOVAN_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_OPTIMISM_ENABLED=true
WEBB_EVM_ARBITRUM_ENABLED=true

RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
HARMONYMAINNET0_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
POLYGON_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
KOVAN_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
OPTIMISM_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>
ARBITRUM_PRIVATE_KEY=<0X_PREFIXED_PRIVATE_KEY>

WEBB_EVM_RINKEBY_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_HARMONYMAINNET0_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_POLYGON_TESTNET_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_GOERLI_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_KOVAN_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_OPTIMISM_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
WEBB_EVM_ARBITRUM_BENEFICIARY=<0X_PREFIXED_ADDRESS>
```

## Quickstart 

Now that you have an `.env` file configured, you can download the relayer docker image, run it, and begin supporting 
the Webb Relayer Network. The docker image makes use of the preset configurations in `/config` and 
by default supports all networks, and system components (e.g. private tx relaying, governance relaying, and data querying).

Follow these instructions to get started:

1. Configure `.env` file in your root directory 
2. Run `docker-compose up` in the `/docker` directory
 

## Exclusive system configuration 

If you wish to only support certain functions within the relayer network you can configure the relayer to only support those functions. 
For instance, you can turn off governance relaying and data querying and only relay private transactions.
