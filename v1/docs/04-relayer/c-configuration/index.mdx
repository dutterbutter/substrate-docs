## Network and Contract Configuration 
 
The relayer's configuration is comprised of two parts:

1. Network configuration
2. Contract configuration 

The network contract configuration is dependent on the network support configuration. That is, you cannot configure
a specific networks contracts without first configuring the network support configuration. 

To configure the relayer we suggest making use of the preset configurations in the `/config` directory. There you will 
see `.toml` files for all the supported networks and contracts. However, if you wish to custom configure 
your relayer you may do so. See below for more details.

### Network configuration

The relayer must be configured with the network support configuration. User's may choose which networks they wish to support 
but must specify these networks in a `.toml` file under the `/config` directory. The current relayer network supports both 
EVM and Substrate based chains but differ slightly in their configuration. 

#### EVM based networks configuration 

The naming convention for the EVM based networks is `[evm.<network>]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the goerli network you need to add `[evm.goerli]` at the beginning of the network configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the goerli network:

```
[evm.goerli]
http-endpoint = "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161"
ws-endpoint = "wss://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161"
chain-id = 5
private-key = "$GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

#### Required Fields

These are the required fields that must be specified in order to support a network.

- Set `http-endpoint` rpc url for a specific node
- Set `ws-endpoint` websocket endpoint for long living connections
- Set `chain-id` (1 for ETH mainnet, 5 for Goerli)
- Set `private-key` of this account on this network (e.g.  "$GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY")

#### Substrate based networks configuration 

The naming convention for the Substrate based networks is `[substrate.<network>]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the Egg network you need to add `[substrate.eggnet]` at the beginning of the network configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the Egg network:

```
[substrate.eggnet]
enabled=true
http-endpoint = "http://standalone.webb.tools:9933/"
ws-endpoint = "ws://standalone.webb.tools:9944/"
runtime = "WebbProtocol"
suri = "//Alice//stash"
pallets = []
```

#### Required Fields

These are the required fields that must be specified in order to support a network.

- Set `http-endpoint` rpc url for a specific node
- Set `ws-endpoint` websocket endpoint for long living connections
- Set `runtime` to indicate what runtime to use
- Set `suri` to generate a key-pair
- Set `pallets` to indicate which pallets to use

### Network contract configuration

The naming convention for the EVM based network contracts is `[evm.<network>.contracts]` and for Substrate consists of `[substrate.<network>.contracts]`. For example, to specify configuration for 
the goerli network you need to add `[evm.goerli.contracts]` at the beginning of that networks contract configuration within the `.toml` file.
An example of the `.toml` file for the contracts on the goerli network:

```
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "SignatureBridge"
address = "0xc11a9f2f42cedf687ec292231698a91dd6928d9a"
deployed-at = 6896976
events-watcher = { enabled = true, polling-interval = 10000, print-progress-interval = 0 }
```

The relayer network is used to support the following contracts:
- Anchor contract
- VAnchor contract
- SignatureBridge contract

To support each contract you are required to specify each contract with the required fields. The required fields are 
dependent on what actions you wish your relayer to perform (e.g. private tx relaying, governance relaying, and data querying).
