# Key rotation

The DKG required network participants to rotate their shared private signing keys in an effort to keep the
network secure. On a new session, the new authorities (from validators or collators) are selected and the
next authorities are selected.

1. These next authorities run **_keygen_** protocol discussed above and output a new group keypair on-chain,
   denoted `next_dkg_public_key`.
2. The current authorities (having already run this process in the step before) see this event and if it is time
   to refresh, they begin to sign the `next_dkg_public_key` with their key, the `dkg_public_key`.
3. The signature from the active keypair of the next keypair is posted on-chain.
4. Once this signature is posted, anyone can propagate it.
   - Any relayer.
   - Any user who wants to update the governor of their contract.
