# Proposal Lifecycle

This page outlines the lifecycle of proposals in the context of the Anchor Update Proposal. It describes the process from proposing an anchor update to submitting a signed proposal.

## How proposals are signed

The below sequence diagram illustrates the steps required to successfully submit an **Anchor Update Proposal**
for signature.

1. **Propose:** Proposers submit an anchor update proposal.
2. **Vote:** Proposers cast their votes to either reject or acknowledge the proposal.
3. **Rejection:** If the majority votes to reject, the execution is canceled, and a proposal rejection event is emitted.
4. **Approval:** If the majority votes in favor of the proposal, the execution to have that proposal signed begins.
5. **Queue:** The proposal is inserted into an Unsigned Proposal Queue.
6. **Fetch:** The DKG-gadget, an offchain service worker, fetches the unsigned proposal from the queue.
7. **Send:** The DKG-gadget sends messages to all connected peers requesting their signatures in the current or next round.
8. **Sign:** Upon the completion of the round, the now signed proposals are processed and stored in offchain storage.
9. **Retrieve:** The Proposal-Handlers offchain worker fetches the signed proposals.
10. **Validate:** The proposal signatures are validated and inserted into pallet storage.
11. **Event:** A ProposalSigned event is emitted, indicating a successfully submitted proposal.
