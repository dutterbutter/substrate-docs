The DKG is a multi-party computation protocol that generates a group public and private key. We aim to use this group keypair to sign arbitrary messages that will govern protocols deployed around the blockchain ecosystem. One primary purpose for the DKG is to govern and facilitate operations of the private signature bridge/anchor system.

For additional information, please refer to the [Webb DKG Rust Docs](https://webb-tools.github.io/dkg-substrate/) üìù. Have feedback on how to improve the dkg? Or have a specific question to ask? Checkout the [DKG Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions/categories/dkg-feedback) üí¨.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses <https://rustup.rs> installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Installation üíª

```bash
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _must_ use the release builds! The optimizations here are required
> as in debug mode, it is expected that nodes are not able to run fast enough to produce blocks.

## Installation Using Nix üíª

1. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
2. Enable [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
3. If you have [`direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv#installation) installed, everything should work out of the box.
4. Run `nix develop` in the root of this repo to get a shell with all the dependencies installed.

<h1 id="usage"> Usage </h1>

<h3 id="standalone"> Standalone Local Testnet </h3>

```bash
./scripts/run-local-testnet.sh --clean
```

This should start the local testnet, you can view the logs in `/tmp` directory for all the authorities and use [polkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer) to view the running testnet.

<h2 id="test"> Testing üß™ </h2>

The following instructions outline how to run dkg-substrate's base test suite and E2E test suite.

### To run base tests

```
cargo test
```

### To run the test orchestrator E2E tests (recommended)

```
# Build the dkg-standalone node
cargo build --release -p dkg-standalone-node --features=integration-tests,testing

# run the orchestrator, making sure to use the proper config
cargo run --package dkg-test-orchestrator --release --features=testing -- --config /path/to/orchestrator_config.toml
```

### Setting up debugging logs

If you would like to run the dkg with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`. You may also want to review [Substrate runtime debugging](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/debugging/).

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```
