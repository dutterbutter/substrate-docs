# Withdrawals on Minerva Bridge

This guide will provide a step-by-step process to assist in making a withdraw on the Minerva Bridge.

## Withdrawal Inputs

You have made an deposit on the bridge and are now ready to withdraw from the shielded pool. It is important to note
to protect and preserve your privacy you should wait some time for subsequent deposits to be made prior to withdrawing
your funds. This will ensure that your withdrawal transaction is not linked to your deposit transaction.

You will notice the **Withdraw** button to be disabled initially. We must provide the details of our transaction
before we can withdraw.

### **1. Select Appropiate Chain**

To get started we want to make sure we are connected to the correct chain. The correct chain is the chain that we
indicated as a our destination chain during the deposit flow. If you are not connected to the correct chain you will
notice that if we try to withdraw it will indicate an insuffient balance error.

### **2. Select Token**

Once you have selected the correct chain we will need to select what token to withdraw from the shielded pool. Clicking
on the token selection component will display a list of tokens. Select the token that is represented in our note.

### **3. Unwrap and Withdraw**

Be advised that deposits into the bridge are wrapped into Webb based asset. For example, if you select `ETH` to be
deposited, it will be wrapped in a Webb wrapped asset (e.g. `webbETH`). This is required to facilitate bridging of
assets across different chains. It's important to note that you can unwrap and withdraw back into `ETH` on the destination
chain as long as there is liquidity available on that destination chain.

## Confirming Withdraw Details

Upon clicking the **Withdraw** button you will be presented with the details of your transaction. It is important to
review these transaction details to ensure they're accurate.

### **2. Confirm Copied Note**

Within the deposit confirmation view, you will need to confirm that you have copied the spend note. The spend note should
be kept in confidence as anyone who gains access to your spend note will be able to withdraw your funds from the
bridge. Your notes are stored locally as you transact through this application as well as encrypted on-chain for persistent storage.

<br />

Once you have confirmed that you have copied the spend note you may proceed to click **Wrap And Deposit** to initiate the transaction.

### **3. Withdrawal In-Progress**

Before the deposit transaction can be sent to the source chain selected we transition through the following stages:

- Fetching transaction leaves
- Generate zero knowledge proof
- Confirm transaction with connected wallet
- Send transaction to selected source chain

You may observe the progress of each stage within the deposit in-progress view. If you would like to proceed with
an additional transaction you can click **New Transaction** and begin on your next transaction. The Minerva dApp
conveniently keeps a notification card with transaction details and progress on the right side to keep you informed
when the transaction is successful.

<WithdrawInProgress />

### **4. Successful Withdraw**

When the deposit transaction is completed you can observe a successful confetti filled message in the notification card!
If you want to see the transaction in a block explorer, click on the **Successfully Withdraw** link within the
notification card.
