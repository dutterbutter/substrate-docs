# Deposit on Minerva Bridge

You have created your `Note Account` and are now ready to make a deposit into the Minerva Bridge. You 
will notice the **Deposit** button to be disabled initially. We must provide the details of our transaction 
before we can deposit.

<br />

<Deposit />

### **1. Select Source Chain**

To get started first select a source chain. Ensure that you have an available balance on the chain that you 
select.

<br />

<SelectSourceChain />

### **2. Select Token**

Once you have selected the source chain we will need to select what token to deposit into the bridge. Clicking 
on the token selection component will display a list of tokens. 

<br />

<TokenSelection />

### **3. Wrap and Deposit**

Be advised that deposits into the bridge are wrapped into Webb based asset. For example, if you select `ETH` to be 
deposited, it will be wrapped in a Webb wrapped asset (e.g. `webbETH`). This is required to facilitate bridging of 
assets across different chains. It's important to note that you can unwrap and withdraw back into `ETH` on the destination 
chain as long as there is liquidity available on that destination chain.

### **4. Select Destination Chain**

You must specify a destination chain during the deposit flow. Be advised that you cannot change the destination chain 
after the deposit transaction is made and its only on this destination chain that you can withdraw from. Select 
the desired destination chain by clicking the destination chain component.
