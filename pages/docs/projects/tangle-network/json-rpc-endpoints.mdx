# Substrate and Custom JSON-RPC Endpoints

RPCs are exposed as a method on a specific module. This signifies that once available, you can invoke any RPC via `api.rpc.<module>.<method>(...params[])`. This is also applicable for accessing Ethereum RPCs using the Polkadot.js API, in the format of `polkadotApi.rpc.eth.*`.

Certain methods accessible via the Polkadot.js API interface are also available as JSON-RPC endpoints on Tangle Network nodes. This section offers some examples; you can request a list of exposed RPC endpoints by invoking `api.rpc.rpc.methods()` or the `rpc_methods` endpoint indicated below.
