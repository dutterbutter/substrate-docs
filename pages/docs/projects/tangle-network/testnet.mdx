# Tangle Testnet

In order to ensure the security, privacy and robustness of the Tangle Network, we are launching a testnet.

The best way to obtain testnet tokens at this time is through the Webb Faucetat https://faucet.webb.tools/.

### Chain Information and RPC

To be added.

### Polkadot Apps Interface
