In many contemporary on-chain governed blockchain networks, the concept of shared power and decision-making is fundamental. These decentralized ecosystems operate under a community governance model, allowing every token holder to have a say in network upgrades and the evolution of its protocol.

The network's governance structure typically encompasses several key roles: the council, the technical committee, and the general token holder population. Each of these roles contributes to the decision-making process, bringing balance to the governance model.

**The Council**, elected by token holders, typically consists of a smaller group of participants who are committed to the sustainability and future of the network. Council members are responsible for proposing referenda, vetoing dangerous or malicious proposals, and representing passive token holders.

**The Technical Committee** comprises network teams and individuals that have a substantial track record of contributions to the ecosystem. This committee primarily speeds up the governance process when urgent protocol upgrades or fixes are required.

**Token holders**, as members of the network, are part of its governance system. They vote on referenda using their tokens, propose changes to the network, and elect the council members. 

A unique feature of such ecosystems is their adaptive quorum biasing, which adjusts the passing threshold of proposals based on turnout. This ensures a fair representation and participation in the system.

Furthermore, an integral part of these blockchain networks is their ability to upgrade and evolve over time without necessitating hard forks. Changes to the network protocol, like runtime upgrades, can be proposed, voted on, and enacted in a decentralized manner without interrupting network services.

In essence, these on-chain governed blockchain networks exemplify how decision-making power can be shared amongst all participants. The ethos of transparency, collective intelligence, and broad participation in these systems pave the way for future blockchain technologies.
