# Tangle Network Overview

The Tangle Network is a specialized platform engineered to support and govern cross-chain Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications. Leveraging the robust Substrate blockchain framework, the Tangle Network forms the core infrastructure to facilitate a new generation of privacy-enhancing and governance-decentralized applications. 

The Tangle Network's unique offering centers around the intersection of cross-chain functionality, advanced governance systems, and the world of ZK applications. Our network seamlessly merges these distinct elements, creating an ecosystem that amplifies the strengths of each component. 

### Powering Cross-chain ZK Applications

The primary objective of the Tangle Network is to cater to cross-chain ZK applications, offering a tailored environment for their operation and governance. Our network transcends traditional chain boundaries, providing a highway for these advanced applications to interact, exchange data, and perform seamlessly across different blockchain networks.

### Built on [Substrate](https://substrate.io/)

The Tangle Network is built on the Substrate, an advanced blockchain framework that grants us flexibility, robustness, and cutting-edge features. This strategic choice ensures that our platform stays ahead in terms of speed, security, and scalability, proving to be a reliable backbone for our network.

### With Unprecedented [Governance](tangle-governance.mdx)

Our innovative threshold signature system (TSS) based governance model sets us apart. It's a type of multi-party computation (MPC) scheme that is a cryptographically secure process to ensure the integrity and authenticity of operations within our network. The TSS-based governance model is capable of effectively managing, maintaining, and safeguarding the cross-chain ZK applications in our ecosystem.
