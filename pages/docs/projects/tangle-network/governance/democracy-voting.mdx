## Voting in Democracy 'Referenda'

Prerequisites to Vote:

- Have a TNT Account
- Have TNT Tokens
- Be prepared to have your TNT locked during the duration of the referenda. See (Governance Parameters for the duration)(/docs/projects/tangle-network/onchain-governance/governance-parameters)
  Additionally, If you vote aye ('approve,' 'yes', 'in support') for a proposal and it passes, your tokens will be locked until the proposal has been enacted (another 7 days.)

### How To

Voting locks all of the tokens in the account you use to vote, and weights your votes accordingly. In order to avoid having your entire TNT supply locked, create a separate voting account and transfer the amount you wish to vote with, over to that account first.

At the end of each launch period, the most seconded proposal will move to referendum. During this time you can cast a vote for or against the proposal. You may also lock up your tokens for a greater length of time to weigh your vote more strongly. During the time your tokens are locked, you are unable to transfer them, however they can still be used for further votes. Locks are layered on top of each other, so an eight week lock does not become a 15 week lock if you vote again a week later, rather another eight week lock is placed to extend the lock just one extra week.

To vote on a referendum, navigate to the "Democracy" tab of Polkadot Apps. Any active referendum will show in the "referenda" column. Click the blue button "Vote" to cast a vote for the referendum.

If you would like to cast your vote for the proposal select the "Aye, I approve" option. If you would like to cast your vote against the proposal in referendum you will select "Nay, I do not approve" option.

The second option is to select your conviction for this vote. The longer you are willing to lock your tokens, the stronger your vote will be weighted. Unwillingness to lock your tokens means that your vote only counts for 10% of the tokens that you hold, while the maximum lock up of 256 days means you can make your vote count for 600% of the tokens that you hold.

When you are comfortable with the decision you have made, click the blue "Vote" button to submit your transaction and wait for it to be included in a block.
