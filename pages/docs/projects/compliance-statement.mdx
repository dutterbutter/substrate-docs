# Compliance and Security

## User Restrictions

Tangle Network and its associated cross-chain privacy bridge are designed for legitimate and lawful use only, and are not to be exploited by means of criminal or illicit activities. Users are obliged to adhere to all laws and regulations of their respective jurisdiction. Usage by politically exposed persons or their associates is strictly prohibited as per prevailing laws.

Before using Tangle Network and its services, users must confirm and accept the following terms:

1. If acting individually, you are of legal age as specified in your jurisdiction.
2. You are not a politically exposed person currently in or recently retired from a prominent public role.
3. You are not an immediate family member or closely associated with a politically exposed person.
4. You are not involved in money laundering or financing of terrorism.
5. Your access to the network doesn't violate any rules, laws, regulations, or directives in your country of residence or jurisdiction.
6. You have never been arrested or convicted of any offense or crime.
7. You are prepared to verify your identity upon request.

## User Responsibility

Use of Tangle Network and its cross-chain privacy bridge is solely at the risk of the user. The codebase, autonomous protocol, and decentralized networks are all open-source and are not controlled by any specific team. Contributors to Tangle Network are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from inherent risks associated with cryptography, blockchain, and digital wallet usage.

The user agrees that the protocol may, at its discretion, implement the following measures or other suitable methods to enhance compliance and security:

1. Deposit Filtering: Utilizing public on-chain metadata and known address blacklists, the protocol may filter out deposit attempts from high-risk addresses.
2. Per-Address Rate Limits: Each address may have a default rate limit for how much it can deposit each day.
3. Global Rate Limits: The protocol may implement a daily global rate limit for deposits across all addresses. Combined, these global and per-address rate limits aim to create high friction for illicit actors like protocol hackers.

The protocol reserves the right to adjust or modify these measures as deemed necessary to better achieve compliance goals and protect the interests of its users.

## Geographical Restrictions

While Tangle Network and Hubble Bridge are in its Alpha stage with minimal restrictions, users must comply with their local, state, and federal laws. We strongly advise checking this before using the network. Certain jurisdictions may be programmatically restricted due to local regulatory authorities' policies that prevent anonymous transactions.

## Anonymity

The Tangle token is not an anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrency in itself; however, when used with our cross-chain privacy bridge, privacy is enabled. For the safety of all users, those from certain jurisdictions may be prohibited from accessing the protocol. Post-alpha, restrictions may be implemented for additional countries based on legal considerations.

## Wallet Compliance

We may, in the future, pursue integrations to ensure that wallets interacting with the protocol do not contain funds from illicit sources. In such a case, suspicious wallets may be barred from depositing into the protocol, and funds may not be withdrawn to such wallets. The protocol may also implement other wallet compliance measures to enhance security and compliance efforts.

By using the Tangle Network and its services, users acknowledge and agree to comply with these measures, subject to updates and adjustments as may be necessary to better ensure compliance and protect the integrity of the network. The protocol aims to create a secure and compliant ecosystem, and user cooperation in adhering to these guidelines is essential for the benefit of all participants.
