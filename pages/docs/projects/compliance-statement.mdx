# Compliance and Security

## User Restrictions

Tangle Network and its associated cross-chain privacy bridge are strictly designed for legitimate and lawful use. All users are expected to adhere to the regulations of their respective jurisdictions. 

### Eligibility and Conduct:

Before accessing Tangle Network and its services, users must confirm and accept the following terms:

- You are of legal age as stipulated in your jurisdiction.
- You are neither a politically exposed person holding, or having recently retired from, a significant public function, nor are you closely associated with such an individual.
- You aren't engaged in activities related to money laundering or financing of terrorism.
- Your access to the network adheres to all rules, laws, regulations, or directives of your residing country or jurisdiction.
- You've never been arrested or convicted for any crime or offense.
- You are willing to provide identity verification when prompted.

### Geographical Restrictions:

While Tangle Network and Hubble Bridge are in their Alpha stage with minimal restrictions:

- Users must ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws before using the network.
- Users from countries listed in the OFAC are denied access to the platform.
- Some jurisdictions might be programmatically restricted if local regulatory policies prohibit anonymous transactions.

### Anonymity:

The Tangle token isn't inherently an anonymous cryptocurrency. However, when paired with our cross-chain privacy bridge, privacy becomes feasible. During the post-alpha phase, more countries may face restrictions based on legal considerations.

## User Responsibility

Use of the Tangle Network and the cross-chain privacy bridge is entirely at the user's risk. The platform's open-source nature — spanning its codebase, protocol, and networks — implies that no specific team holds control. Contributors to Tangle Network aren't accountable for damages stemming from the intrinsic risks of cryptography, blockchain, or digital wallet usage.

### Compliance Measures:

The protocol may employ various measures to enhance security and ensure adherence to compliance standards:

- **Deposit Filtering**: To prevent high-risk transactions, the protocol can filter deposit attempts using on-chain metadata and known address blacklists.
  
- **Rate Limits**: 
  - **Per-Address**: Each address might have a daily deposit and withdrawal limit, capped at 10,000 tokens.
  - **Global**: A daily global rate limit could be set for deposits and withdrawals across all addresses to deter illicit actors.

- **Address and Wallet Screening**: 
  - Address screening will be integrated into the dApp using tools from Chainalysis or TRM.
  - The protocol will utilize the Chainalysis sanctions contract.
  - In the future, wallet integrations may ensure they don't harbor funds from illicit origins. Such wallets could face restrictions, barring them from transacting within the protocol.

The protocol retains the discretion to adapt these measures to better cater to compliance objectives and safeguard user interests.

By accessing Tangle Network and its services, users are in agreement with these measures. They acknowledge that these measures may be updated as needed to ensure enhanced compliance and maintain the network's integrity. All users' cooperation is fundamental to fostering a secure and compliant environment
