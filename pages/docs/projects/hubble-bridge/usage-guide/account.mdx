# Accounts on Hubble Bridge

The Hubble Bridge dApp allows users to manage their notes with an easy to use interface. Prior to depositing
into the bridge, users are required to create a `NoteAccount`. The `NoteAccount` is easily created by having the user
sign a message using their MetaMask account. More precisely, the MetaMask `NoteAccount` uses the first 32 bytes of the signed message
from the MetaMask account as the secret seed. It is with this keypair that users are able to fetch, spend, and manage their
notes right from the interface!

## Creating a `NoteAccount` with MetaMask

The first step to interacting with the bridge dApp is to connect a MetaMask wallet and create a `NoteAccount` using your preferred
MetaMask account. The below steps outline how to go about creating an `NoteAccount`.

### **1. Connect MetaMask Wallet**

When you enter the bridge you will be greeted with the following screen. The bottom button indicates that you are required to
connect a wallet.

<br/>

<ConnectWallet />

### **2. Select Wallet to Connect**

After selecting the 'Connect wallet', you will be prompted to connect to your desired wallet provider.
For the purposes of this walkthrough we will utilize MetaMask. Select MetaMask and wait to be prompted
by your MetaMask extension. If you do not have MetaMask installed, you will need to install it prior to
depositing into the bridge.

### **3. Creating Note Account**

Once connected to your MetaMask account, you will need to create a NoteAccount using the connect MetaMask account.
To do so, select the 'Create Note Account' button as shown below.

<br />

<CreateNoteAccount />

Once selected you will be prompted to agree to Webb's terms and conditions. Select the confirm checkbox, followed with
'Create Note Account'

<br />

<CreateNoteAccountPrompt />

### **4. Sign MetaMask Message**

Upon selecting to 'Create Note Account', users will be prompted by MetaMask to sign a message from Webb. As mentioned above,
we use the first 32 bytes of the signed message from the MetaMask account as the secret seed to create the `NoteAccount` keypair.

<br />

<SignatureRequestPrompt />

Once signed, you will have successfully created your Webb Note Account!!

<br/>

<AccountCongrats />

Now that you have created a `NoteAccount` you can make a deposit into the bridge, view, and manage all your notes from the interface!
