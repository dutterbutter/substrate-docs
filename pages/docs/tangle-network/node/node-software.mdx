# Software and Dependencies

## Binaries

Every release of tangle node includes a Precompiled binary, its currently limited to amd-64 architecture but we plan to
support more soon. You can view all releases [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases).

In the below commands, substitute `LATEST_RELEASE` with the version you want to use, the current latest version is `0.4.6`

**Get tangle binary**

```sh filename="Get binary" copy
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/<LATEST_RELEASE>/tangle-standalone-linux-amd64
```

**Get tangle binary with txpool feature**

```sh filename="Get binary txpool" copy
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/<LATEST_RELEASE>/tangle-standalone-txpool-linux-amd64
```

**Get tangle binary with relayer feature**

```sh filename="Get binary relayer" copy
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/<LATEST_RELEASE>/tangle-standalone-relayer-linux-amd64
```

**Get tangle binary with light-client feature**

```sh filename="Get binary light" copy
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/<LATEST_RELEASE>/tangle-standalone-light-client-linux-amd64
```

### Synchronize Chain Data

Once installed, you can begin syncing your node by running the following command. **Your path may vary depend on whether you used the binary, or built from source**:

```sh filename="Syncing node" copy
./tangle-standalone
```

Once your node has fully syncronized with Tangle Network you may proceed to setup the
necessary accounts to operate a validator or other operations.

## Alternative: Build From Source

In order to build a Tangle node from source your machine must have specific dependencies installed. This guide
outlines those requirements.

#### Rust Dependency

This guide uses [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain. Rust is required to
compile a Tangle node.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```sh filename="Install Rust" copy
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```sh filename="Configure Rust" copy
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

#### Substrate Dependencies

  <Tab>

    Debian version:
    ```sh filename=" Debian" copy
    sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Arch version:
    ```sh filename="Arch" copy
    pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
    ```
    Fedora version:
    ```sh filename="Fedora" copy
    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Opensuse version:
    ```sh filename="Opensuse" copy
    sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
    ```

    Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in different ways.
    For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server might have different packages
    and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the command-line examples are applicable for many common Linux
    distributions, including Debian, Linux Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

Once the development environment is set up, you can build the Tangle node from source.

```sh filename="Clone repo" copy
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle.git
```

```sh filename="Build" copy
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _must_ use the release builds! The optimizations here are required
> as in debug mode, it is expected that nodes are not able to run fast enough to produce blocks.

You will now have the `tangle-standalone` binary built in `target/release/` dir

### Synchronize Chain Data

Once installed, you can begin syncing your node by running the following command. **Your path may vary depend on whether you used the binary, or built from source**:

```sh filename="Syncing node" copy
./target/release/tangle-standalone
```

Once your node has fully syncronized with Tangle Network you may proceed to setup the
necessary accounts to operate a validator or other operations.

### Configuring your Build from Source with Feature Flags

Some features of tangle node are setup behind feature flags, to enable these features you will have to build the binary with these flags enabled

1. **txpool**
   This feature flag is useful to help trace and debug evm transactions on the chain, you should build node with this flag if you intend to use the node for any evm transaction following

```sh filename="Build txpool" copy
cargo build --release --features txpool
```

2. **relayer**
   This feature flag is used to start the embedded tx relayer with tangle node, you should build node with this flag if you intend to run a node with a relayer which can be used for transaction relaying or data querying

```sh filename="Build relayer" copy
cargo build --release --features relayer
```

3. **light-client**
   This feature flag is used to start the embedded light client with tangle node, you should build node with this flag if you intend to run a node with a light client relayer to sync EVM data on Tangle

```sh filename="Build light" copy
cargo build --release --features light-client
```
