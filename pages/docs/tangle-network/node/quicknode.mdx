# Tangle Validator Quickstart

<mark>**Caution:** The following guide is only meant as a quickstart for anyone looking to run a tangle node with minimal
config, this guide uses automated keys and it is not recommended to run a validator using this setup long term, refer to [advanced](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/systemd/validator-node/) guide 
for a more secure long term setup.</mark>

Before following this guide you should have already set up your machines environment, installed the dependencies, and
compiled the Tangle binary. If you have not done so, please refer to the [Requirements](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/requirements/) page.

## Standalone Testnet

### 1. Fetch the tangle binary

Use the latest release version in the url in place of `<VERSION>`, you can visit [releases](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases) page to view the latest info

```
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/<VERSION>/tangle-standalone-linux-amd64
```

For example, at the time of writing this document, the latest release is v0.4.7 and the link would be as follows

```
wget https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases/download/v0.4.7/tangle-standalone-linux-amd64
```

### 2. Start the node binary

To start the binary you can run the following command (ensure you are in the same folder where tangle-standalone is downloaded)

Make sure to change the following params before executing the command

1. `<BASE_PATH>` : This is the path where your chain DB will live
2. `<NODE_NAME>` : This is a unique node name for your node, use a unique name here to help identity your node to other validators and telemetry data

```
./tangle-standalone-linux-amd64 \
  --base-path <BASE_PATH> \
  --name <NODE_NAME> \
  --chain tangle-testnet \
  --port 9944 \
  --validator \
  --auto-insert-keys \
  --telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0" --name <NODE_NAME>
```

If the node is running correctly, you should see an output similar to below:

**Note** : Since the `--auto-insert-keys` flag was used the logs will print out the keys automatically generated for you,
make sure to note down and keep this safely, in case you need to migrate or restart your node, these keys are essential.

Congratulations! You have officially setup an Tangle Network node. The quickstart is only meant as a quickstart for anyone looking to run a tangle node with minimal
config, this guide uses automated keys and it is not recommended to run a validator using this setup long term, refer to [advanced](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/systemd/validator-node/) guide
for a more secure long term setup.. If you are interested
in learning how to setup monitoring for your node, please refer to the [monitoring](../monitoring/quickstart.mdx) page.
