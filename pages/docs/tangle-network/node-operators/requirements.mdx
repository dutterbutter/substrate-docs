# Requirements

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node
is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain, and
facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table and follow the recommended [Polkadot requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

| Component | Requirements                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                               |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).   |
| Memory    | 64GB ECC                                                                                               |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br /> - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |

## Running Ports

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain,
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened.

**Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |

**Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30334 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9934        |
| WS          | 9945        |
| Prometheus  | 9616        |
