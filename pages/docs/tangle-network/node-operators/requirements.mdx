# Requirements

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node
is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain, and
facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table and follow the recommended [Polkadot requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

| Component | Requirements                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                               |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 1 TB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth).   |
| Memory    | 64GB ECC                                                                                               |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br /> - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |

## Running Ports

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain,
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened.

**Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |

**Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30334 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9934        |
| WS          | 9945        |
| Prometheus  | 9616        |

## Dependencies

In order to build a Tangle node from source your machine must have specific dependecies installed. This guide
outlines those requirements.

This guide uses [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain. Rust is required to
compile a Tangle node.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Great! Now your Rust environment is ready! ðŸš€ðŸš€

### Substrate Dependencies

<Tabs items={["linux", "darwin", "windows"]} storageKey="selected-arch-release">
  <Tab>

    Debian version:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Arch version:
    ```bash
    pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
    ```
    Fedora version:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Opensuse version:
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
    ```

    Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in different ways.
    For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server might have different packages
    and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the command-line examples are applicable for many common Linux
    distributions, including Debian, Linux Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

### Build from Source ðŸ’»

Once the development environment is set up, you can build the Tangle node from source.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _must_ use the release builds! The optimizations here are required
> as in debug mode, it is expected that nodes are not able to run fast enough to produce blocks.

You will now have two runtimes built in `target/release/` dir:

1. `tangle-parachain`: Parachain node.
2. `tangle-standalone`: Standalone node, used in the current standalone Tangle network.
