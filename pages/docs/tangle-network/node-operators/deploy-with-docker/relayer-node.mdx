# Deploying Tangle Collator and Relayer

It is likely that network participants that are running a Tangle collator node may also want to run a relayer node. This guide
will walk you through the process of deploying a Tangle collator and a Webb Relayer. By the end of this document, you will have set up a Webb Relayer
at a publicly accessible endpoint alongside a Tangle Collator node both of which will be running within a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

It is a requirement to have Docker installed on the Linux machine, for instructions on how to install Docker on the machine
please visit the offical Docker installation documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

When connecting to Tangle on Kusama, it will take a few days to completely
sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the requirements which can read [here](/docs/tangle-network/node-operators/requirements).

## Docker Quickstart

The quickest and easiest way to get started is to make use of our published Docker Tangle image. In doing so, users simply
create a local directory to store the chain data, download the latest chainspec for parachain testnet, set their keys, and run the start
command to get up and running.

### **1. Pull the Tangle Docker image:**

```
# Only use "main" if you know what you are doing, it will use the latest and maybe unstable version of the node.

docker pull ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-parachain-with-relayer:main
```

### **2. Create a local directory to store the chain data:**

Let us create a directory where we will store all the data for our node. This includes the chain data, keys, and logs.

```
mkdir /var/lib/tangle/
```

### **3. Generate and store keys:**

We need to generate the required keys for our node. For more information on these keys, please see the [Required Keys]() section.
The keys we need to generate include the following:

- DKG key (Ecdsa)
- Aura key (Sr25519)
- Account key (Sr25519)

Let's now insert our required secret keys, we will not pass the SURI in the command, instead it will be interactive, where you
should paste your SURI when the command asks for it.

**Account Keys**

```
# it will ask for your suri, enter it.
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-parachain:main \
     key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-parachain.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type acco
```

**Aura Keys**

```
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-parachain:main \
    key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-parachain.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type aura
```

**Im-online Keys** - **these keys are optional**

```
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-parachain:main \
    key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-parachain.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type imon
```

**DKG Keys**

```
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-parachain:main \
    tangle-parachain key insert --base-path /data \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-parachain.json \
    --scheme Ecdsa \
    --key-type wdkg
```

To ensure you have successfully generated the keys correctly run:

```
ls ~/webb/tangle/collator/chains/*/keystore
# You should see a some file(s) there, these are the keys.
```

### **4. Start Tangle Collator and Relayer:**

The docker-compose file will spin up a container running Tangle Collator node and another running Relayer,
but you have to set the following environment variables. Remember to customize your the values depending on
your environment and then copy paste this to CLI.

```
export TANGLE_RELEASE_VERSION=main
export RELAYER_RELEASE_VERSION=0.5.0-rc1
export BASE_PATH=/tmp/data/
export CHAINSPEC_PATH=/tmp/chainspec
export WEBB_PORT=9955
```

## Update the Client

As Tangle development continues, it will sometimes be necessary to upgrade your node software. Node operators will be notified
on our Discord channel when upgrades are available and whether they are necessary (some client upgrades are optional).
The upgrade process is straightforward and is the same for a full node or collator.

1. Stop the docker container:

```
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID`
```

2. Get the latest version of Tangle from the Tangle GitHub Release page

3. Use the latest version to spin up your node. To do so, replace the version in the Full Node or Collator command with the latest and run it

Once your node is running again, you should see logs in your terminal.

## Purge Your Node

If you need a fresh instance of your Tangle node, you can purge your node by removing the associated data directory.

You'll first need to stop the Docker container:

```
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID`
```

If you did not use the -v flag to specify a local directory for storing your chain data when you spun up your node, then the data folder is related
to the Docker container itself. Therefore, removing the Docker container will remove the chain data.

If you did spin up your node with the -v flag, you will need to purge the specified directory. For example, for the suggested data directly,
you can run the following command to purge your parachain and relay chain data:

```
# purges parachain data
sudo rm -rf /data/chains/*
```

```
# purges relay chain data
sudo rm -rf /data/polkadot/*
```

Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory!
