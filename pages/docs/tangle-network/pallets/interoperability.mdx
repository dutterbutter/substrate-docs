## Interoperability

At the heart of the Tangle Network is an unwavering dedication to blockchain interoperability. This section details our strategy and path towards achieving smooth cross-chain interactions, from bridging assets to providing advanced cross-chain communication avenues.

Cross-chain communication and asset transfer are the primary focuses of our early interoperability strategies.

- **Webb's Hubble Bridge:**  
  Our deployment strategy includes our proprietary and interoperable [Hubble Bridge](https://docs.webb.tools/docs/projects/hubble-bridge/overview/). Hubble is designed to allow the transfer of assets between different chains in a privacy-preserving manner, without compromising on security or efficiency.
  
- **Succinctâ€™s Bridges**  
  Succinct's Bridges are central to our interoperability efforts. Designed as the main channels for asset transfers and cross-chain communications, these bridges utilize cutting-edge cryptographic methods and protocols and ensure efficiency, security, and adaptability in their operations.

- **IBC Pallets:**  
  The integration of IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Pallets sets the foundation for pioneering inter-chain communication and asset transfer methods.
  
- **XCM:**  
  The upcoming inclusion of Cross-Consensus Message (XCM) aims to enhance our capabilities in cross-chain interactions, facilitating complex and diverse interactions across chains.
  
- **Additional EVM Bridge Initiative:**  
  This innovative initiative, the specifics of which are confidential, is targeted towards creating a robust infrastructure for bridging with EVM-compatible chains. Collaborative efforts are ongoing, with an emphasis on evaluating potential grant recipients to bring this vision to life.
