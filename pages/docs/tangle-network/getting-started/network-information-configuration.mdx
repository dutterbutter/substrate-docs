# Quick Start Guide for Developing on Tangle Network

Get started banner

## Quick Overview

Tangle Network is a fully Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on [Insert appropriate relay chain here, e.g., Polkadot]. You can interact with Tangle Network via the Ethereum API and Substrate API.

Tangle Network is a Substrate-based platform that uses a unified accounts system, replacing Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. This allows you to interact with your Tangle account via MetaMask, Ledger, and other Ethereum-compatible wallets, simply by adding Tangle's network configurations. You can also develop on Tangle Network using Ethereum libraries and development environments.

## Tangle Networks

To get started developing on Tangle Network, it's important to be aware of the various networks within the Tangle ecosystem.

| Network | Network Type | Relay Chain | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Tangle 1 | MainNet | [Insert Relay Chain] | [Insert Symbol] | [Insert Decimal] |
| Tangle 2 | TestNet | [Insert Relay Chain] | [Insert Symbol] | [Insert Decimal] |

## Network Configurations

When working with developer tools, depending on the tool, you might need to configure Tangle Network. You can use the following information:

### Tangle Network Configuration

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chain ID | [Insert Chain ID] |
| Public RPC URLs | [Insert Public RPC URLs] |
| Public WSS URLs | [Insert Public WSS URLs] |

## Block Explorers

Tangle Network provides two different types of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API, and others dedicated to the Substrate API. For more information on each explorer, please check out the Block Explorers page.

| Block Explorer | Type | URL |
|----------------|------|-----|
| [Insert Explorer Name] | EVM | [Insert URL] |
| [Insert Explorer Name] | Substrate | [Insert URL] |

## Funding TestNet Accounts

To get started developing on one of the TestNets, you'll need to fund your account with [Insert Token Name] tokens. Please note that these tokens have no real value and are for testing purposes only.

| TestNet | Where To Get Tokens From |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Tangle 2 | [Insert Information] |

## Development Tools

As Tangle Network is a Substrate-based chain that is fully Ethereum-compatible, you can use both Substrate-based tools and Ethereum-based tools.

### JavaScript Tools

| Ethereum | Substrate | Tool | Type |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| [Insert Tools] | [Insert Tools] | [Insert Tools] | [Insert Tools] |

### Python Tools

| Ethereum | Substrate | Tool | Type |
