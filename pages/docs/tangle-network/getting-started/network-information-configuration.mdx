# Getting Started with Tangle Network

## Networks in the Tangle Ecosystem

Before you dive into development, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the different networks within the Tangle ecosystem.

| Network        | Network Type | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Tangle Network | MainNet      | TNT                 | 18                    |
| Tangle Testnet | TestNet      | tTNT                | 18                    |

## Network Configurations

Developer tools may require specific configurations for the Tangle Network. Use the following details:

| Variable        | Value                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Chain ID        | 4006                          |
| Public RPC URLs | `https://rpc.tangle.tools`    |
| Public WSS URLs | `wss://rpc.tangle.tools`      |

## Types for Chain Integration

To find the latest types for Tangle Network, [visit the lookup.tsx file in our Github repo.](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/blob/main/types/src/interfaces/lookup.ts) It automatically produces a full file of the types for the network on changes.

## Block Explorers

We will offer two types of block explorers to accommodate the Ethereum API and Substrate API. Transactions based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can be accessed through the Ethereum API. Conversely, the Substrate API is your go-to for native Substrate operations such as governance and staking. While the Substrate API does provide some details about EVM-based transactions, the information it presents is somewhat limited.

| Block Explorer     | Type      | URL                |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| BlockScout | EVM       | [link](https://https://explorer.tangle.tools/) |
| PolkadotJS| Substrate | [link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer) |

## Funding Your Accounts

Before starting development on our TestNets, fund your account with tTNT tokens, strictly intended for testing purposes and devoid of real-world value. You can obtain this at [Webb Faucet](https://faucet.webb.tools/.)

| Network        | Source For Tokens          |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Tangle Testnet | https://faucet.webb.tools/ |
| Tangle Mainnet | To be announced            |

## Development Tools

As an Ethereum-compatible, Substrate-based chain, Tangle Network allows for the use of both Substrate and Ethereum tools.

| Network   | Tool                                                                             | Type            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Substrate | [Substrate Python Inteface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface) | Library         |
| Substrate | [Polkadot JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/)                             | Library         |
| EVM       | [Web3JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)                                         | Library         |
| EVM       | [EthersJS](https://docs.ethers.io/)                                              | Library         |
| EVM       | [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)                                                  | Dev Environment |

## Participating in the Tangle Network

Joining the Tangle Network community is easy. You can run a node, develop a Dapp, or contribute to our open-source codebase. For more information, visit our [Node Operation Guide](/docs/ecosystem-roles/role-overview/), and [Contribution Guide](/docs/contribute).

## Looking Ahead: Mainnet Launches

Our official Mainnet launch date is forthcoming, so stay tuned! Post-launch, we'll continue to improve the network, working with our community to ensure that Tangle Network remains secure, robust, and user-friendly.
