# Deploying Tangle Validator and Relayer

It is likely that network participants that are running a Tangle validator node may also want to run a relayer node. This guide
will walk you through the process of deploying a Tangle validator and a Webb Relayer. By the end of this document, you will have set up a Webb Relayer
at a publicly accessible endpoint alongside a Tangle validator node both of which will be running within a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

It is a requirement to have Docker installed on the Linux machine, for instructions on how to install Docker on the machine
please visit the offical Docker installation documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

When connecting to Tangle on Kusama, it will take a few days to completely
sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the requirements which can read [here](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/requirements/).

## Using Docker Compose

The quickest and easiest way to get started is to make use of our published Docker Tangle image. In doing so, users simply
create a local directory to store the chain data, download the latest chainspec for standalone testnet, set their keys, and run the start
command to get up and running.

### **1. Pull the Tangle Docker image:**

We will used the pre-built Tangle Docker image to generate and insert the required keys for our node.

```sh filename="pull" copy
# Only use "main" if you know what you are doing, it will use the latest and maybe unstable version of the node.

docker pull ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main
```

### **2. Create a local directory to store the chain data:**

Let us create a directory where we will store all the data for our node. This includes the chain data, keys, and logs.

```sh filename="mkdir" copy
mkdir /var/lib/tangle/
```

### **3. Generate and store keys:**

We need to generate the required keys for our node. For more information on these keys, please see the [Required Keys]() section.
The keys we need to generate include the following:

- DKG key (Ecdsa)
- Aura key (Sr25519)
- Account key (Sr25519)
- Grandpa key (Ed25519)

Let's now insert our required secret keys, we will not pass the SURI in the command, instead it will be interactive, where you
should paste your SURI when the command asks for it.

**Account Keys**

```sh filename="Acco" copy
# it will ask for your suri, enter it.
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main \
     key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type acco
```

**Aura Keys**

```sh filename="Aura" copy
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main \
    key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type aura
```

**Im-online Keys** - **these keys are optional**

```sh filename="Imonline" copy
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main \
    key insert --base-path /var/lib/tangle/ \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json \
    --scheme Sr25519 \
    --key-type imon
```

**DKG Keys**

```sh filename="DKG" copy
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main \
    tangle-standalone key insert --base-path /data \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json \
    --scheme Ecdsa \
    --key-type wdkg
```

**Grandpa Keys**

```sh filename="Grandpa" copy
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data" \
ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:main \
    tangle-standalone key insert --base-path /data \
    --chain /data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json \
    --scheme Ed25519 \
    --key-type gran
```

To ensure you have successfully generated the keys correctly run:

```sh filename="ls" copy
ls ~/webb/tangle/chains/*/keystore
# You should see a some file(s) there, these are the keys.
```

### **4.Creating Docker compose file:**

Now that we have generated the keys, we can start the Tangle Validator and Relayer. We will use the `docker-compose` file provided
in the [Tangle repo](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/deploy-with-docker/relayer-node/).

Let's start by creating a docker-compose file:

```sh filename="nano" copy
nano ~/webb/tangle/docker-compose.yml
```

Add the following lines:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml" copy
# This an example of a docker compose file which contains both Relayer and Tangle Node.
version: "3"

services:
  webb_relayer:
    # Here you should checkout
    # https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer/pkgs/container/relayer/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged
    # For the latest stable version. Only use "edge" if
    # you know what you are doing, it will use the latest and maybe
    # unstable version of the relayer.
    image: ghcr.io/webb-tools/relayer:${RELAYER_RELEASE_VERSION}
    container_name: webb_relayer
    env_file: .env
    depends_on:
      - caddy
    ports:
      - "$WEBB_PORT:$WEBB_PORT"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/config:/config
      - relayer_data:/store
    restart: always
    command: /webb-relayer -vvv -c /config

  tangle_standalone:
    # Here you should checkout
    # https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/pkgs/container/tangle-standalone/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged
    # For the latest stable version. Only use "main" if
    # you know what you are doing, it will use the latest and maybe
    # unstable version of the node.
    image: ghcr.io/webb-tools/tangle/tangle-standalone:${TANGLE_RELEASE_VERSION}
    container_name: tangle_standalone
    env_file: .env
    ports:
      - "30333:30333"
      - "9933:9933"
      - "9944:9944"
      - "9615:9615"
    volumes:
      - tangle_data:/data
    restart: always
    entrypoint: /tangle-standalone
    command:
      [
        "--base-path=/data",
        "--validator",
        "--chain=/data/chainspecs/tangle-standalone.json",
        "--",
        "--execution=wasm",
      ]

volumes:
  relayer_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: $PWD/relayer/data
  tangle_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: $PWD/tangle/
```

### **5. Set environment variables:**

Prior to spinning up the Docker containers, we need to set some environment variables. Below displays an example `.env` file
but you will need to update to reflect your own environment.

```sh filename="export variables" copy
export TANGLE_RELEASE_VERSION=main
export RELAYER_RELEASE_VERSION=0.5.0-rc1
export BASE_PATH=/tmp/data/
export CHAINSPEC_PATH=/tmp/chainspec
export WEBB_PORT=9955
```

### **5. Start Relayer and Validator node:**

With our keys generated and our docker-compose file created, we can now start the relayer and validator node.

```sh filename="compose up" copy
docker compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose` file will spin up a container running Tangle validator node and another running a Webb Relayer.

## Update the Client

As Tangle development continues, it will sometimes be necessary to upgrade your node software. Node operators will be notified
on our Discord channel when upgrades are available and whether they are necessary (some client upgrades are optional).
The upgrade process is straightforward and is the same for a full node or validator.

1. Stop the docker container:

```sh filename="docker stop" copy
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID`
```

2. Get the latest version of Tangle from the Tangle GitHub Release page

3. Use the latest version to spin up your node. To do so, replace the version in the Full Node or validator command with the latest and run it

Once your node is running again, you should see logs in your terminal.

## Purge Your Node

If you need a fresh instance of your Tangle node, you can purge your node by removing the associated data directory.

You'll first need to stop the Docker container:

```sh filename="docker stop" copy
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID`
```

If you did not use the `-v` flag to specify a local directory for storing your chain data when you spun up your node, then the data folder is related to the Docker container itself. Therefore, removing the Docker container will remove the chain data.

If you did spin up your node with the `-v` flag, you will need to purge the specified directory. For example, for the suggested data directly, you can run the following command to purge your parachain node data:

```sh filename="rm" copy
# purges standalone data
sudo rm -rf /data/chains/*
```

If you ran with parachain node you can run the following command to purge your relay-chain node data:

```sh filename="rm" copy
# purges relay chain data
sudo rm -rf /data/polkadot/*
```

Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory!
