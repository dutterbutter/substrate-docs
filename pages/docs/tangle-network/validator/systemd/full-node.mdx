# Running with Systemd

You can run your full node as a systemd process so that it will automatically restart on server reboots
or crashes (and helps to avoid getting slashed!).

Before following this guide you should have already set up your machines environment, installed the dependencies, and
compiled the Tangle binary. If you have not done so, please refer to the [Requirements](https://docs.webb.tools/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/requirements/) page.

## System service setup

Run the following commands to create the service configuration file:

```sh filename="mv" copy
# Move the tangle-standalone binary to the bin directory (assumes you are in repo root directory)
sudo mv ./target/release/tangle-standalone /usr/bin/
```

Add the following contents to the service configuration file. Make sure to replace the **USERNAME** with the username you created in the previous step, add your own node name, and update
any paths or ports to your own preference.

**Note:** The below configuration assumes you are targeting the Tangle Network chainspec.

**Full Node**

```sh filename="full.service" copy
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/full.service > /dev/null << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Tangle Full Node
After=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
User=<USERNAME>
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tangle-standalone \
  --base-path /data/full-node \
  --name <NODE-NAME> \
  --chain tangle-testnet \
  --node-key-file "/home/<USERNAME>/node-key" \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --port 9946 \
  --no-mdns \
  --telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0" --name <NODE_NAME>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

**Full Node with evm trace**

**Note:** To run with evm trace, you should use a binary built with `txpool` flag, refer [requirements](../requirements.mdx) page for more details.

```sh filename="full.service" copy
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/full.service > /dev/null << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Tangle Full Node
After=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
User=<USERNAME>
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tangle-standalone \
  --base-path /data/full-node \
  --name <NODE-NAME> \
  --chain tangle-testnet \
  --node-key-file "/home/<USERNAME>/node-key" \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --port 9946 \
  --no-mdns --ethapi trace,debug,txpool

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

### Enable the services

Double check that the config has been written to `/etc/systemd/system/full.service` correctly.
If so, enable the service so it runs on startup, and then try to start it now:

```sh filename="enable service" copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable full
sudo systemctl start full
```

Check the status of the service:

```sh filename="status" copy
sudo systemctl status full
```

You should see the node connecting to the network and syncing the latest blocks.
If you need to tail the latest output, you can use:

```sh filename="logs" copy
sudo journalctl -u full.service -f
```

Congratulations! You have officially setup a Tangle Network node using Systemd. If you are interested
in learning how to setup monitoring for your node, please refer to the [monitoring](../monitoring/quickstart.mdx) page.
