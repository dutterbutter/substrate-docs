# Private Transaction Relaying

If you wish to only support certain functions within the relayer network you can configure the relayer to only support those functions.
For instance, you can turn off governance relaying and data querying and only relay private transactions. It is important to note
that governace relaying, private transaction relaying and data querying are all on by default.

To set up the relayer exclusively for relaying private transactions we need to add the following fields to under the
`[evm.<network>.contracts]` section:

### Required Fields

- **`contract`**: Name of the contract to support (e.g. "VAnchor", "SignatureBridge")
- **`address`**: Address of the contract
- **`size`**: Represents the minimum size configured for deposit / withdraw on the contract
- **`events-watcher`**: Event watcher should be set to `false` for this strategy
- **`withdraw-fee-percentage`**: Determines the fee taken by this relayer
- **`withdraw-gaslimit`**: Specifies the maximum amount of gas which will be used when submitting a withdraw transaction

Under the `[features]` section we need to turn off data-querying and governance-relaying.

- **`data-query`**: Should be set to `false` for this strategy
- **`governance-relay`**: Should be set to `false` for this strategy
- **`private-relay`**: Should be set to `true` for this strategy (set to `true` by default)

An example configuration file for the goerli network and VAnchor contract should look similar to this:

<Callout type="info">
  You will need to update the linked-anchors and contract addresses for the applicable chains.
</Callout>

```
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "VAnchor"
address = "0x03b88eD9Ff9bE84e4baD3F55D67AE5ABA610523C"
deployed-at = 6896976
size = 0.01
events-watcher = { enabled = false }
withdraw-config = { withdraw-fee-percentage = 0, withdraw-gaslimit = "0x350000" }

[features]
data-query = false
governance-relay = false
private-relay = true
```
