# Quick Start

You can spin up the Relayer in a few simple commands. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started.

By the end of this guide, you will have a running relayer that is publicly accessible via HTTPS endpoint behind a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
- curl

## Installation

In your terminal, run the following command to download the latest version of the relayer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh
```

To install a specific version of the relayer, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh -s <version>
```

This will download the relayer binary (or update it if it already exists) and place it in your `$HOME/.webb` directory. The script
will also suggest adding the directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

### Verify Installation

To verify that the relayer was installed successfully, run the following command:

```bash
~/.webb/webb-relayer --version
```

## Dapp Integration

After completing the above steps, submit a PR with changes for your https endpoint in the [Webb Dapp](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp) repo.
