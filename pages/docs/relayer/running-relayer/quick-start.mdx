# Quick Start

You can spin up the Relayer in a few simple commands. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started.

By the end of this guide, you will have a running relayer that is publicly accessible via HTTPS endpoint behind a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
- curl

## Installation

In your terminal, run the following command to download the latest version of the relayer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh
```

To install a specific version of the relayer, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh -s <version>
```

This will download the relayer binary (or update it if it already exists) and place it in your `$HOME/.webb` directory. The script
will also suggest adding the directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

### Verify Installation

To verify that the relayer was installed successfully, run the following command:

```bash
~/.webb/webb-relayer --version
```

## Configuration

Before running the relayer, you will need to configure it. The relayer could be configured by using TOML or JSON files along with environment variables.
The Relayer will look for configuration files in the default locations, but you can also specify the path to the configuration file using the `--config` flag.

- Default locations for configuration files:

  - `$HOME/.config/webb-relayer/` (Linux)
  - `$HOME/Library/Application Support/tools.webb.webb-relayer/` (macOS)

For simplicity, we will use the TOML configuration file format in this guide and we will place the configuration file in the default locations.

### Download the Example Configuration File

To download the example configuration file, run the following command:

<Tabs items={["Linux/WSL", "macOS"]} storageKey="selected-binary">
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webb-tools/webb-relayer/master/config/example/config.toml -o ~/.config/webb-relayer/config.toml
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webb-tools/webb-relayer/master/config/example/config.toml -o ~/Library/Application\ Support/tools.webb.webb-relayer/config.toml
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure the Relayer

Open the configuration file in your favorite text editor and take a look at the configuration options. The configuration file is well-documented and should be self-explanatory.

## Dapp Integration

After completing the above steps, submit a PR with changes for your https endpoint in the [Webb Dapp](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp) repo.
