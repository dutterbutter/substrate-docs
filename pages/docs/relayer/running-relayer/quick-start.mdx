# Relayer Quickstart

You can spin up the Relayer in a few simple commands. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started.

By the end of this guide, you will have a running relayer that is publicly accessible via HTTPS endpoint behind a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
- curl

## Installation

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to download the latest version of the relayer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh
```

The script will download the relayer binary (or update it if it already exists) and place it in your `$HOME/.webb` directory. The script will also suggest adding the directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

Alternatively, if you wish to download a specific version of the relayer, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/get-webb-relayer.sh | sh -s <version>
```

This will download the relayer binary (or update it if it already exists) and place it in your `$HOME/.webb` directory. The script
will also suggest adding the directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

### Verify Installation

2. Verify that the relayer was installed successfully by running the following command:

```bash
~/.webb/webb-relayer --version
```

## Configuration

Before running the relayer, you will need to configure it. The relayer could be configured by using TOML or JSON files along with environment variables.
The Relayer will look for configuration files in the default locations, but you can also specify the path to the configuration file using the `--config` flag.

- Default locations for configuration files:

  - `$HOME/.config/webb-relayer/` (Linux)
  - `$HOME/Library/Application Support/tools.webb.webb-relayer/` (macOS)

For simplicity, we will use the TOML configuration file format in this guide and we will place the configuration file in the default locations.

### Download the Example Configuration File

To download the example configuration file, run the following command:

<Tabs items={["Linux/WSL", "macOS"]} storageKey="selected-binary">
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webb-tools/webb-relayer/master/config/example/config.toml -o ~/.config/webb-relayer/config.toml
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webb-tools/webb-relayer/master/config/example/config.toml -o ~/Library/Application\ Support/tools.webb.webb-relayer/config.toml
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure the Relayer

Open the configuration file in your favorite text editor and take a look at the configuration options. The configuration file is well-documented and should be self-explanatory.

<br/>

<RelayerExampleConfig />

### Environment Variables

The relayer can also be configured using environment variables. The environment variables will override the values in the configuration file.
For example, if you want to override the `port` value in the configuration file, you can set the `WEBB_PORT` environment variable.

For example, to modify the `port` value using the environment variable, you can do the following:

```bash
export WEBB_PORT=9955
```

For our example configuration file, the following environment variables are required:

- `PRIVATE_KEY` - The private key of the relayer. This can be a hex-encoded private key or a mnemonic phrase.

create a new file called `.env` in the same directory as your current directory and add the following line:

```bash
# Hex-encoded private for the relayer (64 characters) prefixed with 0x
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
```

save the file and exit the editor.

## Running the Relayer

To run the relayer, run the following command:

```bash
~/.webb/webb-relayer -vvv --tmp
```

<Callout type="idea">
  The `--tmp` flag will start the relayer with a temporary database. This is useful for testing, but you should not use this flag in production.
</Callout>

You should see the following output:

```

### Verifying the Relayer is Running

To verify that the relayer is running, you can use the `/api/v1/ip` endpoint:

<Tabs items={["Local", "Server"]} storageKey="selected-binary">
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9955/api/v1/ip
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    curl http://<your-server-ip>:9955/api/v1/ip
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You should see the following output:

```json
{"ip":"<your-public-ip>"}
```

**Congratulations**! You have successfully started the relayer.

## What's Next?

Now that you have the relayer running, you need to run it behind a reverse proxy. You can use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) for this.

Once you have the relayer running behind a reverse proxy, you should be able to access it from your domain name. For example, if you are running the relayer on `relayer.example.com`, you should be able to access the relayer at `https://relayer.example.com/api/v1/ip`.

After that you may like to configure the relayer by supporting more chains. You can find more information about that in our [Relayer Configuration examples](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer/tree/main/config).

## Dapp Integration

After completing the above steps, submit a PR with changes for your https endpoint in the [Webb Dapp](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp) repo.
