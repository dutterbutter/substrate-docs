# Relayer Cloud Setup

This document serves as instructions for setting up a Webb Relayer at a publicly accessible endpoint. It will fulfill the requirements for listing your relayer on `app.webb.tools`. In order to integrate your relayer to `app.webb.tools`, please submit a PR.

- Connections available via https and wss on your domain.

### Instructions

These instructions will assume the user has created a cloud server on Ubuntu 20.04, and is logged into a user with sudo permissions.

By the end of these instructions, the relayer will be running and accessible via your endpoint with nginx behind a reverse proxy.

### Basic Environment Setup

```
### Setup the machine's environment ###

# Update ubuntu packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 
# Update snap packages
sudo apt install -y snapd
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
 
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install gcc cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev
sudo apt install build-essential
 
# Install rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
export PATH=~/.cargo/bin:$PATH
source ~/.cargo/env
 
# Install certbot
sudo snap install --classic certbot && sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
 
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer.git
cd relayer && cargo build --release --features cli
```

### Relayer setup

1. Setup the relayer as a system service:

```
# Create the service file
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/webb-relayer.service
 
# This assumes the repo has been cloned in the home directory of the user
# Paste the following into the service file, and replace the <user>:
 
[Unit]
Description=WebbRelayer
 
[Service]
Type=exec
WorkingDirectory=/home/<user>/relayer
ExecStart=cargo run --features cli --bin webb-relayer -- -c /home/<user>/relayer/config/<configs> -vvv
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. Kick off the system service:

```
sudo systemctl enable webb-relayer && sudo systemctl start webb-relayer
```

### Nginx Setup

1. Configure your registered domain name with your cloud service provider.

2. Install nginx if it isn't already on your machine:

```
sudo apt install nginx
```

**First, we will configure the endpoint linked to your domain name at port 80 for certificate generation**

3. Create nginx site files for your domain:

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available &&
 
sudo cp default <domain name> &&
 
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<domain name> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

4. Modify the nginx sites-available file to:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
 
    root /var/www/<domain name>/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
 
    server_name <domain name>;
 
    location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

5. Check the nginx configuration

```
sudo nginx -t
```

6. If no issues exist, restart the nginx service:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Next we will create the self-signed certificate and reconfigure for https and wss support**

7. Create the self-signed certificate:

```
sudo certbot certonly --nginx
```

8. Modify the nginx site file:

```
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}

server {

    # SSL configuration
    #
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
 
    root /var/www/<domain name>/html;
  
    server_name <domain name>;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain name>/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain name>/privkey.pem;
    ssl_session_timeout 5m;
    ssl_protocols SSLv2 SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers   HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
 
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9955;
        proxy_pass_request_headers on;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
}
```

9. Check nginx configuration and restart.

### Monitoring Setup

Relayers will want to setup monitoring to ensure maximum uptime and automatic restarts when things go awry.

1. `sudo apt install -y monit`

2. modify the monitrc file at: `/etc/monit/monitrc`

```
set httpd port 2812 and
use address localhost
allow localhost
 
set daemon 10
set log /var/log/monit.log
set idfile /var/lib/monit/id
set statefile /var/lib/monit/state
set eventqueue
    basedir /var/lib/monit/events
    slots 100
 
check process webb-relayer matching target/release/webb-relayer
    start program = "/bin/systemctl restart webb-relayer"
    stop program = "/bin/systemctl kill webb-relayer"
    if cpu > 90% for 20 cycles then exec "/bin/systemctl stop webb-relayer" and repeat every 10 cycles
    if cpu > 90% for 64 cycles then exec "/bin/systemctl kill webb-relayer" and repeat every 10 cycles
    if cpu > 90% for 64 cycles then alert
    if does not exist for 1 cycles then start
```

3. restart monit and validate:

```
sudo monit reload && sudo monit validate
```

### Dapp Integration

After completing the above steps, submit a PR with changes for your https endpoint: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/blob/master/packages/apps/src/configs/relayer-config.ts#L14">Webb Dapp</a>.
