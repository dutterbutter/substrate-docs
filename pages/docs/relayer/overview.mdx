# Relayer Overview

In the Webb Protocol, the relayer is a multi-faceted oracle, data relayer, and protocol governance participant.
Relayers fulfill the role of an oracle where the external data sources that they listen to are the state of the
anchors for a bridge. Relayers, as their name entails, relay information for a connected set of Anchors on a bridge.
This information is then used to update the state of each Anchor and allow applications to reference, both privately
and potentially not, properties of data stored across the other connected Anchors.

The relayer system is composed of three main components. Each of these components should be thought of as entirely
separate because they could be handled by different entities entirely.

1. Private transaction relaying (of user bridge transactions like Tornado Cash’s relayer)
2. Data querying (for zero-knowledge proof generation)
3. Data proposing and signature relaying (of DKG proposals)

## Private Transaction Relaying

The relayer allows for submitting proofs for privacy-preserving transactions against the Mixer, Anchor and
VAnchor System. The users generate zero-knowledge proof data, format a proper payload, and submit it to a
compatible relayer for submission.

## Data Querying

The relayer also supplements users who need to generate witness data for their zero-knowledge proofs. The
relayers cache the leaves of the trees of Mixer, Anchor or VAnchor that they are supporting. This allows users
to query for the leaf data faster than querying from a chain directly.

## Data Proposing and Signature Relaying

The relayer is tasked with relaying signed data payloads from the DKG’s activities and plays an important role
as it pertains to the Anchor System. The relayer is responsible for submitting the unsigned and signed anchor
update proposals to and from the DKG before and after signing occurs.

This role can be divided into two areas:

1. Proposing
2. Relaying

The relayer is the main agent in the system who proposes anchor updates to the DKG for signing. That is, the
relayer acts as an oracle over the merkle trees of the Anchors and VAnchors. When new insertions into the
merkle trees occur, the relayer crafts an update proposal that is eventually proposed to the DKG for signing.

The relayer is also responsible for relaying signed proposals. When anchor updates are signed, relayers are
tasked with submitting these signed payloads to the smart contract SignatureBridges that verify and handle
valid signed proposals. For all other signed proposals, the relayer is tasked with relaying these payloads
to the SignatureBridge instances and/or Governable instances.

The responsibility for a relayer to the DKG (governance system) can be summarized as follows:

The relayers act as proposers of proposals intended to be signed by the distributed key generation protocol (DKG).

1. The relayers are listening to and proposing updates.
2. The DKG is signing these updates using a threshold-signature scheme.

We require a threshold of relayers (really proposers) to agree on the update in order to move the update into
a queue for the DKG to sign from.
