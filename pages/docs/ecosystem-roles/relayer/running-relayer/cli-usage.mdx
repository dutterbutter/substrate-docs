# Command-Line Reference

When starting up your own Webb relayer, there are some required and optional flags that can be used.

This page provides a comprehensive list of the available command lines available on the Webb relayer.

After installing the Webb [`relayer`](/repo/docs/getting-started/add-to-project) binary (or pull from Docker), you can view the relayers command line interface (CLI). For a complete list of the available flags, you can spin up your relayer and input `--help`
to the end of the command. The command will vary depending on how you choose to spin up your relayer, and if you're using Docker or Systemd.
