# Logs

If you would like to run the node with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`.

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```

# Troubleshooting

## P2P Ports Not Open

If you don't see an Imported message (without the [Relaychain] tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

## In Sync

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either Imported or Idle messages and have connected peers.

## Genesis Mismatching

If you notice similar log messages as below:

```
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.

## Troubleshooting for Apple Silicon users

Install Homebrew if you have not already. You can check if you have it installed with the following command:

```sh filename="brew" copy
brew help
```

If you do not have it installed open the Terminal application and execute the following commands:

```sh filename="install brew" copy
# Install Homebrew if necessary https://brew.sh/
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date, install openssl
brew update
brew install openssl
```

❗ **Note:** Native ARM Homebrew installations are only going to be supported at `/opt/homebrew`. After Homebrew installs, make sure to add `/opt/homebrew/bin` to your PATH.

```sh filename="add PATH" copy
echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

An example `bash_profile` for reference may look like the following:

```sh filename="export PATH" copy
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH
export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include
export RUSTFLAGS='-L /opt/homebrew/lib'
```

In order to build **dkg-substrate** in `--release` mode using `aarch64-apple-darwin` Rust toolchain you need to set the following environment variables:

```sh filename="export" copy
echo 'export RUSTFLAGS="-L /opt/homebrew/lib"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Ensure `gmp` dependency is installed correctly.

```sh filename="install gmp" copy
brew install gmp
```

If you are still receiving an issue with `gmp`, you may need to adjust your path to the `gmp` lib. Below is a suggestive fix, but paths are machine / environment specific.

Run:

```sh filename="clean" copy
cargo clean
```

Then:

```sh filename="export" copy
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib:$(brew --prefix)/opt/gmp/lib
```

This should be added to your bash_profile as well.

Ensure `protobuf` dependency is installed correctly.

```sh filename="install protobuf" copy
brew install protobuf
```
