# Requirements

The current Tangle testnet is a standalone network, meaning that it is not connected to the Polkadot or Kusama relay chain.
Since the Tangle is not a parachain, the size of nodes are quite a small build as it only contains code to run the standalone Tangle network and not syncing
the relay chain or communicate between the two. As such, the build is smaller, and does not require the same minumum spec requirements as a parachain node.

The following specifications are the ideal or recommended, but nodes can be run with less. Testnet nodes have also been run using AWS t3.Large instances.

| Component | Requirements                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz                                                               |
| Storage   | An NVMe solid state drive of 500 GB (As it should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth). |
| Memory    | 32GB ECC                                                                                               |
| Firewall  | P2P port must be open to incoming traffic: <br /> - Source: Any <br /> - Destination: 30333, 30334 TCP |

## Running Ports

As stated before, the standalone nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the standalone,
while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P.

**Default Ports for a Tangle Full-Node:**

| Description | Port        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P2P         | 30333 (TCP) |
| RPC         | 9933        |
| WS          | 9944        |
| Prometheus  | 9615        |

## Dependencies

In order to build a Tangle node from source your machine must have specific dependecies installed. This guide
outlines those requirements.

This guide uses [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain. Rust is required to
compile a Tangle node.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Great! Now your Rust environment is ready! ðŸš€ðŸš€

### Substrate Dependencies

<Tabs items={["linux", "darwin", "windows"]} storageKey="selected-arch-release">
  <Tab>

    Debian version:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Arch version:
    ```bash
    pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
    ```
    Fedora version:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
    ```
    Opensuse version:
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
    ```

    Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in different ways.
    For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server might have different packages
    and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the command-line examples are applicable for many common Linux
    distributions, including Debian, Linux Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

### Build from Source ðŸ’»

Once the development environment is set up, you can build the Tangle node from source.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _must_ use the release builds! The optimizations here are required
> as in debug mode, it is expected that nodes are not able to run fast enough to produce blocks.

You will now have the `tangle-standalone` binary built in `target/release/` dir

#### Feature Flags

Some features of tangle node are setup behind feature flags, to enable these features you will have to build the binary with these flags enabled

1. `txpool`

This feature flag is useful to help trace and debug evm transactions on the chain, you should build node with this flag if you intend to use the node for any evm transaction following

```bash
cargo build --release --features txpool
```

2. `relayer`

This feature flag is used to start the embedded tx relayer with tangle node, you should build node with this flag if you intend to run a node with a relayer which can be used for transaction relaying or data querying

```bash
cargo build --release --features relayer
```

3. `light-client`

This feature flag is used to start the embedded light client with tangle node, you should build node with this flag if you intend to run a node with a light client relayer to sync EVM data on Tangle

```bash
cargo build --release --features light-client
```

### Use Precompiled binary ðŸ’»

Every release of tangle node includes a Precompiled binary, its currently limited to amd-64 architecture but we plan to 
support more soon. You can view all releases [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/releases).

In the below commands, substiture `LATEST_RELEASE` with the version you want to use, the current latest version is `0.4.6`
